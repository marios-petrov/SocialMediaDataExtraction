"For the past few weeks I've been trying to sync my RGB components in my new pc. Led strip case fans cooler fans gpu. I have tried every single software you can think of and it does not work. Either one of them are never detected won't change color or it just resets on startup. Half the software is bloatware & the alternatives such as open RGB sucks and gets me nowhere. I'm at a loss and have ripped a good chunks of my hair out and have determined RGB is officially bad for my mental health. I have NO CLUE why the most difficult thing in the world to do is to sync colors in a glass and metal box.EDIT: I've tried signal and openrgb. Both didn't do jack sadly."

"Desired resolution for gaming is 1440p and planning on playing Hogwarts Legacy and future games on 60fps for at least the next few years. My specs are:- RTX 3080- ryzen 2600- 3000mhz 2x8gb ram- 650W psu - corsair TX650M - Asrock B450 pro4 moboWondering if it would be a sensible decision to upgrade my CPU or wait?And if I upgrade do I upgrade to 5600x (~£150)? 5800x? 5800x3d (~£300)? Or a 7000 series CPU + motherboard?I'd like the decision I make to be economically viable so I don't want to just waste money and go for a top end cpu and new motherboard if a 5600x would be similar enough for instance. I don't really have a budget but want the decision to be sensible.If necessary I am open to upgrading RAM too.Thanks!"
"Hey everyone I have a Ryzen 5700X with a 3070TI 2 RAM sticks an MSI mpg gaming edge wifi MoBo along with an outtake fan and my CPU coolermaster running on 750W PSU. Is turning on gameboost a good idea with this setup and beyond that would I even notice a difference in games with my rig?"
"I know that both AMD and Intel have made strides with APU's in recent years and I'm curious what kind of gaming performance it's possible to get out of these things at the lower end. If I purchased a Ryzen 5 5600G for example can it run less demanding/older games? Some examples I would like to play are Darkest Dungeon Slay the Spire Stardew Valley Stellaris Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and possibly Disco Elysium.Is that a reasonable expectation for an APU? I have a PS5 for AAA games but some games (like the above examples) are better IMO with mouse and keyboard."
"Hi. I have 16GB 3200MHz RAM (2x8GB) and I want to upgrade it to 32GB. I have Asus TUF B450 Pro-Gaming motherboard and it has 4 RAM slots.I wanted to ask should I buy 2x16GB RAMs or just add 2 more 8 gigs? Is there any performance difference between 4x8GB and 2x16GB?Getting 2x16 is much more expensive than adding 2 more 8 gigs. It will cost almost twice as much. If there isn't any performance loss with 4 sticks of ram I'll buy 2 more sticks.Edit: I've just found cheaper Corsair 2x16GB sticks. If I sell my 2x8GB sticks it will cost almost the same now. You can tell your opinions considering there isn't any price difference now. Thanks in advance!"

"So simply i have this pc from my friend and I'm truing to setup the corsair fans naimly the rgb portion of them and they are not playing ball. I have 2 fans that came with the H100i platinum water cooler and they seem to plug into the rgb hub and the command center no problem.There is also another non rgb fan that is also fine. The problem is there are 3 other rgb fans that have one cable as a normal pwm dan cable ( i think) but the other is this wierdly big 4 pin female plug that's quite chunky and doesn't fit into any of the ports. The case also came with an adapter that takes all 3 of these wierd plugs from the fans and combines them into another plug that looks more like the ones from the aio fans but it's still too wide to fit in the tgb hub or the commander pro. I'm assuming maybe these are old fans from a different generation of product but I'm not sure of anything. So can anyone help me identify these fans and plugs and suggest a solution on how to get this working with the commander pro please. And what should I do with the cables from the aio there are quite that I have no idea what they do. https://imgur.com/a/dgnBLNa"

First is i wanna add some ram since i have 4 spots and 2 are not used i wanted to know of its compatible to add any type of ram because i was thinking abput adding 2x 16gb kingston fury renegade ddr5 i made some research didnt have an exact answer so im asking here. And second thing is i wanted to know if cooling system is upgradable because my cpu is always at 100 degerees when gaming except if i put my fans at high speed which it stays in the 80degrees level and last question is it okay if i keep my fans at hogh speed or it can damage them in the long run.

"Hello thereI’ve completed my new build (Strix B650E-I Ryzen 7950x everything brand new) but sadly can’t get it to boot to Windows installation. I can access BIOS just fine everything seems to behave correctly (CPU and both RAM sticks are detected temps are OK fans are OK) but when exiting BIOS I just can’t boot from there neither to an USB stick to install Windows nor to an SSD with a Windows bootable partition already installed (from a previous build). After the ASUS logo I get a black screen for like 10 seconds then the PC reboots itself and keeps looping like that forever unless I manually get back to the BIOS during the logo.I’ve already tried to :* Set up boot priority order boot override* Enable/disable CSM secure boot fast boot and every possible combination of these* Make other USB Windows bootable sticks use different brands try different USB ports* Update BIOS clear CMOS* Plug the HDMI cable directly into the motherboard iGPU instead of the GPU* Physically remove the GPU* Use different PSU cables use another PSU* Unplug all fans and peripherals* Leave only 1 stick of RAM (2\*32 Gb DDR5 4800 at stock settings no EXPO or OC or whatever) switch sticks switch slots for every possible combinationAll of the above still leads to the exact same problem.I’m completely clueless for what to do next and have no other explanation than either the motherboard or the CPU came faulty (in that case can’t determine which one since I would need another AM5 mobo/CPU to troubleshoot).Hence asking for leads or advice before returning everything ?Cheers"
"Threadripper 2950X Asrock Taichi x399 64GB Corsair ram.(GPU taken out)Hi my PC randomly turned off during a regular session nothing to cause it to overheat. It wouldn't POST after that. Power button seems to do nothing.I bought a cheap PSU tester first of all which appeared to show it was functioning. But I purchased a replacement motherboard (mATX version) and have connected that power supply to it. So far without RAM or the CPU installed. I wanted to at least get a Dr Debug reading before going through the pain of installing the heatsink. But the same problem remains.So my question is firstly has anyone tried turning on this motherboard with nothing but power? As far as I can tell it should at least try to post and give an error. I'll try with a single stick of ram tomorrow.Secondly does this sound like a power supply issue given the two motherboards seem to behave the same way? The blue pulsing LED turns on when the power is connected but that's it. I'm hoping it's not the CPU but seems unlikely."

"I recently was gifted a new motherboard and CPU things I was intending on upgrading.

"Currently I own a [DeepCool Matrexx 30](https://www.deepcool.com/products/Cases/fulltowercases/2021/11958.shtml) PC case and only have 1 fan in the back for expelling hot air. I got a new GPU ([Powercolor Fighter 6650XT](https://www.powercolor.com/product?id=1650273595)) and the temperatures have been running very hot and have tried a lot to lower the temperatures but I hate that the fans run too loud. I read online that increased intake airflow should help with the temperature issues and to do so I should add more intake fans to the case or the option I am heading towards is buying a new case and fans.My overall question is would changing to a case with better airflow ([Pop Air Mini](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/pop/pop-mini-air/rgb-black-tg-clear/) is my case of choice as I like the look of it) help my overall GPU temps? I realize this is a stupid question as my common sense is telling me yes but to what extent would it help. Will it fix my issues by a significant amount or just by a couple of degrees?"
"I have pc case that can have 2 or 3 120mm intake fans but for exhaust fan it can only have 1 exhaust fan currently i use my pc without side panel and no fans.

I have rx 570 and ryzen 5 2600.Also i am planning to upgrade to ryzen 5 5600x and looking to buy cooler under 145mm is cooler master hyper h411r a nice option ?"
"Hey friends I've been thinking of adding ideally 6 fans to replace the two stock ones that come with the 4000d airflow only issue is I don't think I'd be able to fit the two top exhaust fans with how large the DH-15S is no real room. So my main reasoning for making this post be 1. Would it be worth to try and cram the two exhaust ones right about the DH-15S or would it be better to just add the front 3 and exhaust fan in the back without having things either too cramped or straight up touching 2. What's the go to case fans right now? I was thinking of the arctic 5 pack everyone raves about but hearing the coil wine at 1000RPM makes me open to really anything. 3.

"Edit: nvme is 2TB. sata SSD is 1tb.So I'm having trouble figuring out best way to do this. Situation.. Doing new build. All new. Mobo ram etc.I want to re use the sata SSD from my old build(W10) as the windows drive for the new build.I installed a brand new fresh never formatted NVME ssd on new mobo/build also.So.. how do I do this? 1. Do I just plop the old SSD with windows already on it from old comp into new build and just turn it on? Will that even work?If that will work how would I then prep it for a windows 11 install OVER the existing windows 10 install? I DO NOT need any files off the drive.2. Can I or should I use my external dock to pre wipe the old windows drive? I have a spare comp I could use for this purpose. If I should do this how exactly do I? I assume Windows has a utility to just clear it? Would it be as simple as just re formating the drive? Not 100% sure if that would clear the old OS as I've never done this specific thing with drives before.3. Or should I just use the NVME as an OS drive?My original plan was to use sata SSD for OS and then use NVME for games/programs. It sounds like OS on NVME doesn't make much difference from my research. Boot times are fast enough on sata SSD to me. I just want faster game/program loads which I know the NVME will provide (if noticeable is another thing..)"
"So since my 65 years old PC (i5 6600k & GTX 1070) got a litte slow and I want to be prepared for the next 6 years of gaming (currently waiting eagerly for Starfield) I thought it´s about time to upgrade.  I got a 1440p Monitor.[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qCd3pH](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qCd3pH)Yes I´m an RGB guy sry for that.I already got a 850W powersupply and a 2TB ssd so that´s why it´s not in the list.The prices in the partpicker do not all match for my country my total cost is at 2250€ so far (my current PC was about 1.3k lol).With some components I´m indecisive.For the CPU cooler I´m considering also the Arctic Liquid Freezer II (but I really dislike the look of the cooling unit) and the NZXT Kraken x73.For the case I´m thinking about the NZXT H7 Flow or Elite too.For the GPU I´m pretty sure that I want a 4070Ti but not sure which one.Actually I don´t like a lot of their cooler designs.Taking DDR4 RAM would save me some money but at least DDR5 is giving a bit of performace boost. At least as far as I could see in some blogposts/youtube videos. And since I want to keep the PC for a long time  I feel like I should take the current technology.I took the K version of the CPU because when my i5 started to feel slow I OC it to 4.4GHz and could keep it a longer. I kind of like it to tweak a litte at the hardware too.Tbh I didn´t really consider AMD for CPU/GPU.I get a RX 7900 XT for the same price as an 4070Ti but the 4070Ti is stronger.I never had a AMD CPU before and I feel like you may get a better price performance ratio but Intel makes the better (supported) products. But feel free to disagree.Any opinions appreciated."
"Recently my PC has started to randomly turn off - for whatever reason exclusively when I play FIFA 23. Sometimes PC will turn off after a simple quick PSU reset (power off-on on it) sometimes I had to do the "hold power button for 30 seconds on a disconnected PC" thing and that seemed to help. No weird noises or other external effects I could notice.I'm pretty sure it's not the most resource-heavy game I play (e.g. I played a bit of CoD:MW2 2022 with no issues in the same period of time as well as the latest Hitman but with that I'm not entirely sure how heavy it is on CPU or GPU).What concerns me is I have had the same system for quite a while and never had any issues like this. I had to relocate recently and along that process I've changed my case and CPU cooler (went from NZXT X62 to Deepcool AK620). I was worried it might be the overheating but I've ran HWiNFO64 in logging mode got to a point of random shutdown rebooted the PC and checked the logs before the shutdown - seems like stats are just fine I couldn't find anything suspicious (I can share a subset of that CSV but all the temp sensors weren't anywhere near their maximums in the logged period). I'd consider a faulty build (i.e. a cable connection being iffy somewhere) but then PC wouldn't only turn off when I play FIFA and literally no other game/app usage has lead to the same outcome so far (been a few days).So with me recently relocating and rebuilding the PC possible issues could either lie with the game (seems extremely unlikely and then all I can say is "W T F") or PSU being faulty due to some lingering damage in the relocation process (seems weird the PC turning off would only happen in one game but maybe the load profile is specific and "triggers" it in some way or I've just been lucky). Am I missing some other angle that might be the issue?Basic specs:AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D Gigabyte Geforce RTX 3080 VISION 32 GB of GSkill 3600CL16 DDR4 RAM MSI MEG X570 ACE Seasonic Focus Plus Gold 650W PSU."
"I bought a PC ages ago but along the line the GPU broke. The PC was given to a relative under the requirement that I find out what exact model GPU it is and if I could get a similar if not better GPU replacement. [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/3mtJy5p) is a picture of the insides and a picture of the case iirc the PC was a prebuild I bought used roughly 10 years ago so I think the GPU is the one that it was sold with. Please let me know if anyone can identify this GPU and maybe even a replacement GPU of similar if not better performance the PC would be mainly used for storage multi media and occasional round of games such as AoE."

"Got a prebuilt PC. The AIO radiator is mounted at the front of the pc with 3 fans that are pushing the air towards the radiator. Then at the end of the pc there is in intake fan. Is this a correct setup? Because I noticed that if the glass panel is put on the computer the temps go up so high as 90 celisus on load but if I take off the side panel it drops to 70 ...

"So I spend some amount of time for choicing cpu upgrade for me. Currently running with i5-9400f+rtx2060+16GB DDR4-2400 in plans - run to rtx3070 - but firstly decide to update cpu since would like play some PS3 games maybe try some simple video editing (anime fundub timing) also i'm software developer currently didn't code on computer have enough load on work but sometimes can catch mood to try something.And quite confused what to choice. Living in Serbia tricky to find something. Also higher price - higher overpay to resellers so think to this time save some money maybe in 2-3 years move to another country or get opportunity to visit EU and buy something. And can't decide what to choice.i5-13600kf - it's intersting maybe good option for 2+ years to wait for some good AMD option (never trust AMD but maybe it's time to give a chance) but with b660+ddr4 - well maybe to overpower especially considring that almost not have time to play games and still try to find time to complete some older games (like Control nier: replicant (btw that why I need good emulation performance - Drakengard 3 is next game to play after completing zelda series on switch) cyberpunk etc).So maybe i5-13500 is an option or some other cpu. Not quite sure. i5-13600kf maybe as some safty bag in case if amd still not offer something or if 14-15th gen of intel will have some troubles so just upgrading to z790+ddr5+oc can give some new breath.About prices - i5-13600kf - from 310€; i5-13500 - 268€; i5-13400f - 215€; i5-12600kf - 265€;MSI PRO B660M-A DDR4 - 15300 €; ASROCK Z690 Pro RS - 17600 €; Asrock Z790m Pg Lightning/d4 - 17200€Cooling quite hard to find Deepcool Ak620 Black = 5600 €;  Be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4 = 7600 €; Noctua NH-D15 - 10500 €;so since it's from resellers something can be out of stock or with available with even higher price"

I would love input on whether the default AMD cooling solution is good enough for this build.**Motherboard: Gigabyte B450M DS3H WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard.**This is basically the cheapest AM4 motherboard with Wi-Fi capability that I could find in my country. I have a pitiful 6mbps internet so Wi-Fi is not a bottleneck in terms of my network use and I don't want to run LAN cable through my house. My current computer has a PCI Wi-Fi card but it can't be reused with a modern PCI-Express mobo. I would greatly appreciate tips on how to solve this for cheaper. I do need Wi-Fi.**Memory: 2 X Kingston FURY Beast 8 GB (1 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory**Again I am focusing on bang for my buck here. I know 3600 is better but the price increase is steep. I do plan on getting 2 x 8 sticks instead of a slightly cheaper 16 gb stick because of Dual Channel. Is this still advantageous to have? In my current build (2 x 4GB DDR 3 1333) I noticed a significant performance improvement when I started running Dual Channel but that was back in 2015.**Video Card: MSI GeForce RTX 2060 VENTUS GP OC GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB Video Card**Right now thanks to all the recent crypto troubles these can be had used for about half their new price. This opportunity for a modernish RTX card is kind of what made me pull the trigger on deciding on this build. I do plan on buying it through a platform that has buyer protection and benchmark it for several days to ensure stability and good temps. In my personal opinion I'd rather buy a GPU from a miner who undervolted it for efficiency and ran it 24/7 at constant-ish temperature as opposed to buying it from a gamer who OC'd it and ran it at peak load and idle alternatively causing thermal cycling but I am open to any information or suggestions you might have on the topic.**Power Supply: Corsair CX650M 650 W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply**I decided on this power supply because electricity here is expensive and I'd rather have a larger power supply for increased efficiency as I would not be demanding anywhere near its full potential. I did pick one from a reputable vendor even though there are many cheaper alternatives because I am interested in protecting all my other expensive components.Regarding all other components I have them already (SSD HDD's for extra storage ATX case peripherals etc.)I am looking forward to hearing your opinions and ideas on this build. Again my target is 1080p Ultra gaming. I would specially like to be able to play Microsoft Flight Simulator with several mods such as addon airplanes and scenery. I don't need 60 fps for flight simulation a consistent 30 would be perfect but it has to be consistent and with the graphics settings cranked up.I have currently budgeted for the cost of this build (250.000 ARS) but keep in mind I would be paying about half the list price for a used GPU. With a brand new GPU it would go to 310.000 ARS and that would be beyond my reach. I could stretch my 250.000 ARS budget by about 20% but I would need a compelling reason to do so. I am specially interested in bang for the buck ideas.  Thanks for your time. I deeply appreciate any insight or ideas you might provide."
"So I wanted to build my first desktop PC. I have zero experience in this therefore have been reading a lot the past few months. I need a PC for studying / work media consumption but also gaming.I've been seeing that for gaming 144Hz is basically considered standard nowadays. However I have found a monitor that would be perfect for my needs (I also care a little for the design and I really don't like the stands of a lot of gaming monitors). It's 4K but only has 60 Hz. I want to use this monitor as long as possible at least 5 - 7 years so I am also concerned whether it will be enough for future games.I am not a heavy gamer but I have always been interested in some popular games. I never had a console or a desktop PC and only was able to watch let's plays wishing I could play the games myself.Now that I have my own money I want to play some of those games like the Mafia series Outlast Red Dead Redemption Detroit: Become Human Resident Evil series GTA series COD and more. I'm mostly interested in the story lines and most likely won't be going online e.g. in GTA or COD.  After playing all those games I've missed out on I guess there will be some newer games / games that will come out in the future that I will want to play. But I'm not someone who has to try every new AAA game coming out every year. So my question is **would a 60 Hz desktop be enough for some offline gaming for Triple A games?**"
"So I’ve just brought all the parts to build my first PC. As I was putting my CPU in (AM4 slot) I didn’t secure it probably and it fell out as I was attaching my motherboard to my case (I know what an idiot).I should also mention I see no broken pins on the CPU.I’ve managed to unbend the pins and I’ve now got it in the slot and secured probably. So the question. Once I’ve finished building the rest of the PC is there any way I can test the CPU works before I put on my Liquid CPU cooler? I’m concerned that if I put the CPU cooler on and the CPU does not actually work then I’ll have to take the cooler off and ruin the thermal paste it comes with and have to buy some more thermal paste along with a new CPU."
"Hey guys so I am looking to build my first gaming pc. I have been studying pc parts for a while and what they do but would like some experts to help me if they can. I'm looking to build something under $1100 that will be running a lot of my games at 1080p and at least medium settings a majority of the time. I will be playing regular games like rdr2 God of war Dead space(remake) and Marvels spider man. I will be running vr games like half life alyx and bonelab/boneworks.[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/RXT8gb](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/RXT8gb)"
"As the title goes I’m struggling to get Windows on this pc because of undetected NVMe so I want to use my own to open Windows partition the other (undetectable) drive and then install it on there. Would this impact my data or Windows copy on my own NVMe?"
"I just finished building my first computer and went to install windows 11 on it after i finished doing some steps in the installation it said that that my computer isn’t compatible. It has a i5-12400f and a rx 6700 xt 16gb of ddr4 ram and 1tb ssd."
"What cpu gonna be better "investment" as i like to justify spending on pc parts. In my country they are the same prace maybe $10 mobo as well same with the ram cuz i just wanna go with ddr5 and dont mind looking in future how ddr5 is now better. ye so 13600k or 7700x plus 7700 is much more expensive than 7700x idk why. thx for your opinions"

"My backordered 6800 xt doesn't seem to be happening. Thinking about canceling and buying something in stock. The is a sapphire pulse 6800 non xt for 490 or a asrock oc 6950xt for 700. I could do either but not sure if the 6950 is overkill for 1440p at 165htz. I would like this card to perform well for the next 5 years if possible.Any opinions on which of these is the better option for my situation?"
"https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DCHkBjMy friend asked my if I can put together a build for him at a ~$600 price point. He's new to PC gaming and said he just wants to play mostly emulators and a few modern games at 1080p and as long as the games run he'd be happy. I'm fortunate enough to be able to spend the money to get what I want and don't have as strict budget restrictions when I'm building/upgrading my own PC so I've never had to budget like this. I was wondering what you all think of this build?"

I've heard that the ASUS PRIME B550m-A heats up fast on high end CPUs and I really want to have a build that supports AURA SYNC. Will my 5600x or 5600 make my ASUS Prime heat up fast even with all the cooling I have? And if you have some mATX AURA SYNC supported mobo suggestions please let me know. I am looking for about 120usd to 150usd ASUS Mobo since Im on a pretty strict budget on each part. Thanks in advance!Edit: I do coding play games like League Valorant and Apex if that bit of info helps."

"Context:**My laptop**: [HP 14-cf0006dx](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-14-cf0000-laptop-pc/20395769/model/26556551) Running Windows 10**Current wifi adapter in laptop**: [Realtek RTL8723DE 802.11 bgn 1x1 WiFi + BT 4.2 Combo Adapter](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl8723de)**Goal**: I'm planning to swap this 2.4 Ghz only adapter to a dual band adapter that recognizes both 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz.------------------------------My laptop's manual lists 5 compatible wifi adapters ([p. 38 under 'WLAN' module](http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c06146792.pdf)) one of which is the [Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 9461](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/125193/intel-wirelessac-9461/specifications.html) (the one I'd been planning to get). (P.S. It appears there are two separate models of the 9461: 9461NGW which is  M.2 2230 and 9461D2W which is M.2 1216. Based on the part number in the laptop manual I'm under the impression that it's the 9461NGW that's compatible with my laptop.)**Questions/Concerns**:When looking up that Intel wifi adapter (9461NGW) there are clear differences in how it looks compared to my current wifi adapter. I'm uncertain if these differences will prevent it fitting in my laptop. I have pictures for reference:*Picture#1* (current adapter): [Realtek RTL8723DE](https://imgur.com/a/iB06mhO)*Picture #2*: [Intel 9461NGW](https://imgur.com/a/H1wqSPo)There's three differences I noticed:- Realtek (pic 1 current one) is A+E key and the Intel is just E key- The Realtek appears longer/skinnier and the Intel appears more like a square- The main "notch" (not sure the word?) to hold the Realtek in place is on the top left whereas on the Intel it's on the top but directly in the middle.Will any of these things prevent that Intel adapter from fitting in my laptop? If so maybe means maybe I have misunderstood which version of Intel 9461 my laptop manual is referring to.  ([This source](http://en.techinfodepot.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Realtek_RTL8723DE_Combo_Module) says my current Realtek's form factor is 1630 not sure if that is useful.)"

"My friend bought an Asus Prime B660M/A D4 with 12400f the board and CPU and RAMs work fine.Since he was short on budget I gave him my old GTX 1060 to fire up his rig until he gets a proper one.Surprisingly the 1060 was not recognized by the motherboard and the MB’s buzzer made a long noise following three short ones which indicates that there is a problem with GPU.I knew the card is fine but to make sure of it I installed it on my own system (z370 motherboard) and it worked perfectly fine.Then I installed my RTX 3070 on his system and everything worked just fine.I even tried to fire up his rig with my PSU to eliminate every possibilities which may have made the system not to boot up.I also updated the motherboard BIOS to the most recent version and still nothing.At this point I’m just clueless. The card isn’t even that old and the motherboard can not recognize it? How??Do you have any solutions in mind? I’m just frustrated…"
"Just bought the Gigabyte P750GM and started hearing some bad things about them exploding about a year ago... Should I be fine? If it did fail would I see corruption on any of my other hardware?"
"What are bottlenecks?"

"Hey there! So I've had a mate of mine who runs a pest control business ask me to help him sort a new PC for his office. I asked him what kind of programs he uses and he told me "Word emails and the calendar." I think we might need a 4060 at least.So obviously I could just tell him to go to JB Hi-Fi and pick up whatever piece of shit they've got for $500 but I'm not a sadist.I've put together this list: https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/NQk4fvI've gone with the Ryzen 5 5600G for it's excellent CPU performance and solid integrated graphics letting me skip out on an e-waste GT 1030 or equivalent. I'm aware I could pick intel but I don't really know where to start there. If you can go cheaper or get more features from intel by all means sling me an intel superior.I'm not super sure how to sort the RAM - more faster is more better obviously but the 5600G ostensibly maxes out at 3200. I'd like to go 3600 or above and run it at 1:2 FLCK but how big's the chance that the 5600G tells me to get fucked leaving that extra money spent on better RAM unused?The Seasonic 500w Focus Core... Well I can't find very much about this PSU. Doesn't seem to appear on PSU hierarchy lists. It's Seasonic which I'm keen for but it's double the price of other PSUs in this wattage range. Ideally it'd sit there in the office PC for the next ten years without a hiccup. Any other questions or things to point out go nuts. I've got a date in an hour but I'll be pretty active in dialogue with all you wizards after that <3"
"Sorry if my question is unclear. There are 90 and 180 degree adapters for the 8 and 6 pin connectors on graphics cards and a 90 degree adapter for the 24 pin connector. Has anyone seen a set of these for the 8 and 4 pin CPU connections?The adapters for GFX are keyed for those and so far that is all I've found. The lower gauge wires of the PSU make the cables hard to bend and they are getting in the way of the AIO I want to mount. Any info or suggestions are appreciated thank you."
"Ok to start I wanted to run a small screen to run msi afturburner on. Im using windows 11 and a 3080ti. My main monitor is connected by Display port and the 7 inch is hdmi.

Heres my dilemma.I run afterburner and if I drag it to the right of my screen and beyond it goes to the 7" no problem (also shows the taskbar at the bottom) If i open browsers they all open fine on main but if i try to run a game it will open on the 7".I am probably overlooking something stupid.

"Edit: Ive since updated the AMD Chipset drivers. And apparently according to this post its a thing with AMD systems?er. Kerbal is modded and leaks memory like a siv which is why I mention it. This has happened before playing another modded game. Valheim.The display freezes on the last frame. So I dont think its a GPU issue. All fans go to a default mode so to speak. They dont rev up they all just flat line. The keyboard and mouse die. No functionality and I cannot turn the PC off using the power button AND the reset on the mobo doesnt work either. I have to kill the power switch.I turn it back on PC boots fine and all is seemingly well. This is rare although im afraid it will become less rare.

I have the same issue and  internet is full of this issue. Source of this problem is fTPM (firmware  based TPM). If you are running Windows 10 you can disable fTPM in the  BIOS and your issues will be gone. If you are runnig Windows 11 you are  out of luck since Windows 11 requires enabled TPM 2.0 and AMD  implementation sucks. They don't have dedicated HW based TPM but only  firmware based TPM.**Since you have  more recent CPU (i have Ryzen 7 3700X) you can try to update your  motherboard bios to latest version if possible (version F15 has latest  AGESA 1.2.0.7) and also install latest AMD chipset drivers.**If  your Event log stops filling with Event ID 86 errors related to SCEP  certificate enrollment errors your issue is resolved.

"This came up on a Facebook group the other day. Someone commented they wanted to make sure their motherboard would allow them to undervolt or underclock their Intel i9 series CPU so it wouldn't get too hot.I made the suggestion of just limiting the Maximum Processor State from Windows (Control Panel->Power options->Change advanced power settings) to either 90 or 95% of that was a concern.  If you aren't familiar with this setting there's a [pic here of what I'm suggesting](https://i.imgur.com/QQyKYh6.png).[https://i.imgur.com/QQyKYh6.png](https://i.imgur.com/QQyKYh6.png)And then a few folks chimed in and said "not the same thing".  My opinion is that just allowing Windows to throttle the processor usage with the scheduler is way safer than playing with voltages and effectively achieves the same effect.  I'm happy to be educated on the differences."

"Building several family PC's atm and spare/old parts from their previous builds cascading down to other builds.So for example My bedside PC which was an i5 Haswell 4570S on an itx mobo in an [Antec ISK110](https://hardforum.com/threads/antec-isk-110-vesa.1681715/post-1038638442) uSFF case is going to my dad to replace his tiny but dog slow Celeron Beebox thingy. Was just supposed to be an SSD swap.....except a week before the swap the aforementioned PC starts acting up.The behaviour is that when switched on it will basically switch itself on and off over and over fan starts to spin up stops spins up again stops etc etcIts got a PSU like [THIS](https://www.ebay.ie/itm/185568946716?hash=item2b34c56a1c:g:pu8AAOSw5JhjF9Dg) and a laptop type 90w power brick.Now If I hook up a regular ATX 450w PSU to this mobo the system powers up fine so I know there is nothing wrong with the MoboRamCPUSSDHDD etc. I know its not a faulty case on/off switch because thats not used to power on the system outside of the case. I simply bridge the mobo pwr pins.Is there any way I can tell whether its the PSU PCB board where the issue lies or in the laptop type 90w power brick. Power brick will cost about 20 euro but PCB about 50 euro. If I need to replace both its starting to get into the territory where it starts to make more sense to spend about double and upgrade dad even higher into a HTPC style case like a Node 202 with SFX PSU and throughing in a spare GTX1080 I have lying around. He'll never use the GPU but maybe I'll set it up with Steam Family SHaring and can play some of my steam library on his PC when visiting minding the dogs etc."

"Let me try to describe my issue. I have a ROG Strix B360-H Gaming motherboard. I already have an nvme SSD installed in my PC and have had no issues for the 5 years I have had that. I just got a new Kingston Fury drive. Everything will be going fine however after a random amount of time everything running on that drive will crash and when I go to windows explorer and try to open folders on that drive I get the error "Location is not available". I have ran SMART tests and it comes back fully working however when the issue arises it does not come up in this software anymore. My current theory is there is an issue with how the drive is installed but I have twice removing it and redoing it changing screws etc. and nothing seems to fix it. I ordered screws from amazon to try those tomorrow but I was wondering if there's anything else to do in the meantime."

"This is about 2ish hours of gaming (new hogwarts legacy). My cpu is a ryzen 5 5600 and my first build using stock cooler[https://imgur.com/a/0fbljT1](https://imgur.com/a/0fbljT1)That red 90.3c kinda freaked me out. The fans get real loud which is probably obvious but kinda getting me worried.I know this is def on the hot side but Is this temperature very dangerous for the cpu? Like am I at risk of any proper damage occurring to it at any point soon or at risk of decreasing the life-span of it significantly.I'm thinking of getting a better cooler but the original actual build I had a mate helping with everything. So I'm not just gonna call anyone over for a cooler replacement.I dont want to risk fucking up and breaking the cpu if I don't actually "need" to. (what I mean by that is having it at these temperatures on load is not going to cause any significant damage or harm etc)"

Booted up just fine from the start. Fast forward to yesterday and checked my windows update for anything new. There were two updates it was working through - the first one was downloaded installed and awaiting restart. The second was in the process of installing (20% ish)While this was happening I went to check on my Nvidia drivers and there was an updated driver ready for download. Additionally my GeForce experience updated itself on launch with no issues. After the Nvidia driver had downloaded I selected "Perform a clean installation" and the update started to run. What I didn't anticipate was that during this I was given a GeForce notification countdown stating that it needed to restart. I don't ever remember ever getting a timed countdown during this step usually it's a restart now/later prompt (I could be misremembering).I'm 99% sure the windows update wasn't done in stalling when the restart occurred. After the restart everything seemed to be working as intended with the windows screen telling me it was updating and to not restart/power down whatever it says. I let it do it's thing and once complete my computer restarted again leading to it's current state.Current status and things I've tried so far - Both monitors are using DP cables. I've tried each monitor individually at restart - no signal detected.I've tried both monitors with HDMI together and separately - no signal detectedPlugged both monitors into my laptop and they are both working.Tried booting up with no USB or DP/HDMI plugged into the computer - no signal detectedDoesn't seem to be a power issue as components are lighting up/turning on/fans spinning etc.No motherboard codes - starts up just fine and displays "AA" just like it always has.Tried rebooting into BIOS with no change.Tried doing a CMOS clear with no change other than now the MOBO code is displaying as "02" - AP initialization before microcode loading. Which I assume is it launch into the BIOS?Prior to doing the CMOS clear it my fans and ram would change their colors according to my Asus Aura settings so that tells me that it is likely a GPU issue? Would those settings prompt if the OS was broken?The motherboard also doesn't have any onboard graphics so I can't bypass the GPUIs this a driver issue for the GPU? Is there a way to load up drivers via USB?Will a new windows install fix this? Is there anyway to preserve the files on my SSDs? Can I take a new SSD load windows on it and then clean off my other SSDs with an external drive?Only other option I have is to swap out my GPU for a new 3080ti I have on hand.It feels to me like this is a software thing but I'm all out of ideas.

"HelloI am planning to get a new computer. I would like to get the Asus ROX Strix Z790-F Gaming Wifi Mainboard and the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360 AIO. I am worried about the compatibility though.  I've read from a user who has the Z790-E version that he had to file down the mounting brackets a bit because they interfered with the upper VRM heat sink on the ROG Strix Z790-E WIFI motherboard.  Can anybody confirm and is there a similar issue with the Z790-F version? In case there is an issue with compatibility can you recommend a similar mainboard from a different manufacturer which definitely fits?"

"I recently bought a used ASUS Strix 3080 12GB that was only 4 months old and a new RM850x to go with it.I noticed that when the GPU is under load I can smell a bit of a sweet plastic scent coming from the case. I did a walk around smelling different areas and it seems to be coming from the GPU though I'm not 100% sure. The smell seems to be concentrated around the GPU and CPU cooler area and I can smell it coming from the exhaust fan at the back of the case as well. I don't think it's the PSU.The GPU was very clean still had a lot of the clear plastic stickers that protect the decorative bits of the shroud until earlier today.I inspected all the cables in the case and nothing to indicate melting but I can't see if there are other connector affected inside the GPU without removing the cooler and shroud. The 8-pin connectors to the GPU get warm but not hot.I've been in touch with the seller (who seemed like a pretty transparent and decent person) and he didn't seem to have any concerns when he had it but also said he kept the PC on the floor.Other than the smell and a bit of coil whine I don't see anything alarming. Am I just not used to the smell of new electronics? Am I missing something?"

"Hi everyone. Wondering what could be causing my issues here. My GPU will not go above 75% load in Hogwarts Legacy as well as one other game. In MW19 it hangs around 99% to 100%. Temps remain stable at around 65c to 72c. CPU load is negligible in most games it seems and clock speed jumps from 4100-4200. Running 4K ultra in Hogwarts Legacy and game seems to run smoothly despite the low load on my GPU. Im not sure if this is normal or if it is a possible CPU bottleneck. Any thoughts?

Always planned to upgrade whenever I felt like performance wasn't satisfying. I know Hogwarts Legacy currently has problems and it will get better with patches/drivers but I also felt dissatisfied recently when I played games like MW2/WZ2 and Spider-Man: Miles Morales last year (hitting 60 - 85 fps) though I didn't think of upgrading because I didn't really care about MW2 and I couldn't upgrade yet when I was playing Miles Morales.Looking to either upgrade to a 3060ti/3070 or upgrading to a Ryzen 5600 + New motherboard (eventually will upgrade both probably). The question I need answered is which is more important to upgrade? The GPU or CPU? Especially for upcoming single player games like Hogwarts Legacy Starfield Suicide Squad God of War Ragnarok (whenever it comes out on PC) etc. Just want to have \~120 fps on 1080p with at least decent graphics settings on those types of games.Regarding Hogwarts Legacy specifically I was on medium settings and it was averaging 60-80 fps but often stuttering terribly and lowering it to low made it relatively smoother. Also looking at task manager it said that CPU usage was very high around 70-100% and GPU was pretty low at 20-50% does that mean my CPU is bottlenecking?Also to note I can get the components at basically MSRP or at least pretty near so that won't be an issue."

I also tried a spare gtx 1070 and that produced no signal either.Next I tried swapping the ram out for different sticks to see if one had gone bad that didn’t work either.After this I swapped the power supply for a spare 600 watt thermal take that I have and that produced the exact same result.At this point I assumed either the cpu or motherboard was dead and based on the symptoms I assumed motherboard.  I tried to replace it with an MSI B550 tomahawk board and to my surprise the system STILL WOULDNT BOOT (with or without graphics card both psu’s tried on new mobo).  I was getting pretty frustrated here but I thought at least it’s almost certainly the cpu.  So I went back to Best Buy returned the tomahawk board and purchased a Ryzen 7 5800x.  I know my x570 board has the most up to date bios as I updated it a few weeks ago.  I put the system all back together and it STILL WONT BOOT.

At this point I’m afraid both the motherboard and cpu decided to die together in one big crash.Anyone have any ideas?"

I want to play strategy games smoothy (eu4 civ6 cities skylines with mods etc) and some bigger RPG and FPS titles on medium settings (i think 1080p on 60fps is fine for me on GPU demanding titles but would like to play strategy games on 1440p).Another reason for the CPU heavy build is that i also want to be able to do some music production in Ableton Live.Some other considerations:* CPU: I'm considering 12600KF as well but looking at price vs performance 13600 seems worth the higher cost.* GPU: Might be a bit low for this CPU. I'm also considering 6800XT and 3060TI but i don't really need high end graphics on the newest titles.

"I heard the 6800XT and 6950XT are the best choice for 1440p 144Hz games but my build just cannot handle that for whatever reason. I started off with a 6800XT for my first build two months ago and I’ve been having stuttering issues ever since. I returned that and upgraded to a 6950XT to see if that’d fix my stuttering issues but it hasn’t helped at all. It’s exactly the same as it was before. Now I regret upgrading to a 6950XT… this is my current build: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YNmtfvI thought that a 6800XT could handle lightweight games like Hades and Neon White or games from a long time ago like Doom Arkham Origins and Arkham Knight at 4K144Hz but apparently not. Maybe it’s just my system being bad with all my stuttering issues but it seems these GPUs just can’t handle 4K even in games that are 10 years old (though Knight is poorly optimized to be fair). However should it be able to handle games at 1440p upscaled to 4K with Radeon Super Resolution? In the games I’ve tried out it seems my performance is exactly the same with and without RSR. I still get the exact same stuttering issues with and without RSR so I guess it’s not much of a performance hit. That corroborates with what I’ve read about it online at least.I changed literally everything in my build 2-4 times. I tried 2 GPUs 5 CPUs 3 SSDs 3 RAM kits 4 motherboards 2 monitors 2 DP cables an HDMI cable new thermal paste an internal sound card an external USB sound card a Wi-Fi card (versus integrated Wi-Fi since my first mobo didn’t have Wi-Fi) an extension cord a surge protector my outlet itself unplugging all my peripherals except my mouse and keyboard changes to BIOS and Windows settings downloading apps like Process Lasso and RTSS disabling Windows services disabling unnecessary drivers downloading all my necessary drivers and even more. The secondary monitor I used to test was only a 1080p 60Hz monitor so it was difficult to test. However I just tested games at 1080p60FPS on my main monitor as well. I saw that my performance was the same between both monitors. Maybe I should get another 4K or 1440p monitor to actually test it out better though. Is it possible my monitor could cause stuttering though? I’ll try to change my PSU too though that’s probably not causing my problems. I bought a power conditioner so I’ll try that. Im going to buy an uninterruptible power supply as well if that doesn’t work."
"I am a blender user. With 3.4 update my chronic slowness on complicated stuff got unbearable. (i7-3770 GTX 1060 3gb DDR3 16Gb RAM). I doubled the RAM and got no improvement. I have invested in a RTX 3060 12Gb and if anything it is worse. I changed the PSU to 1050w (overkill maybe but it was a great offer). I presume my CPU is bottlenecking which I understand means a change of CPU and mobo. 1. Is there a foolproof way of knowing that bottlenecking is the issue?2. I can't really afford much more. I can just about afford a Chinese mobo with an E5-2620 v3. I have looked at benchmarking and from what I understand the E5 is a bit better. But my question is this: Am I likely to see much of a performance improvement from my i7-3770 or have I got to wait till I can afford a bit more like say an i5-10400F or even better? Or go for Ryzen 5? Thanks if anyone has lived through something similar."

"(This is a question about what to do AFTER a pc is built.)Does anyone know of a comprehensive guide for taking a Windows 11 Pro install and:1. Removing all telemetry2. Removing all unnecessary start up processes. The machine will be used only in a home office will run office firefox and occasional other programs. There's a printer and a backup server on our home net. It will never be booted off the network. Etc. etc.3. Basically given the 7GB/sec M.2 drive I am installing I would expect windows to boot in \~5 seconds. How do I make that happen?I'm getting the last bits of this new build tomorrow so will start assembling and testing. And that leads me to the last question:4. What burn-in software do you recommend?Here's the build if you are interested: [Workstation build](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KvPMtn) .Thanks in advance.Note: for #1 above I did find [remove win11 telemetry](https://windowsreport.com/disable-windows-11-telemetry/) but I can't tell if the steps are "and" or "or" since e.g. step 2 in that link seems it would turn off all data collection. So I'd like to see some confirmation as to exactly the steps needed.I'm aware of the \~2GB Windows 11 "shrunk install" but I'm not going to install some one else's ISO. Just tell me what you did instead...P.S. I used to visit Microsoft back in the 90's and one thing I noticed is that the engineers' version of Windows I saw looked NOTHING like what I had at home... so even then significant customization was possible. But I'm not asking for that! -- yet..."
"Hi I'm very much a noob when it comes to building PCs and not great at the tech language but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me.  I've been needing to get a new CPU for a while now but looking around I found out that processors that fit the socket my motherboard has have been discontinued. (LGA1151)  So it seems like I'll have to get a new motherboard as well.   What I need help with is how I can figure out what motherboard will fit my current components. My current motherboard is ROG STRIX B360-F GAMING  I am unsure of what info you might need in order to help me so feel free to ask me and I'll try to find it."

My question is will this effect my PC negatively having way too much wattage or am not gonna need a PSU for the next 10 years provided it lasts that long!"
"hey everyone so quick story yesterday my pc worked flawlessly. no temp issues no motherboard issues etc. I usually shut off my pc when I'm going to bed and then I turn it on in the morning. I did the same thing today and it didn't turn on. I went crazy because how can it suddenly just not turn on after no issues? I did have some issues installing a new cooler the day before. The cooler is a Deepcool ak620 and I thought that was the issue so I cleaned the thermal paste off and looked under the CPU everything looked fine and had no bent pins. After going mad for about 10 minutes I went to the discord of buildapc and someone very helpful suggested the paper clip test. After I insert the paper clip I hear a clicking sound and then the fan very slightly moves and then stops. Okay after I’ve written this. A couple of things happened1. The fans did start spinning fully when I inserted the paper clip.2. The PC turned on after I replugged everything back in.3. After 1-2 minutes on everything shut down and there was no power.I will  leave my specs below."

"It all started when I wanted to upgrade my CPU. The first thing I wanted to do was to update my bios. And here is the problem:After the update was at 100% Ive gotten a blackscreen and I didnt do anything for an hour after that I shut my pc down since nothing was happening. Now I have a blackscreen all the time. Every fan still spinning lights turning on and my gpu cpu ram and psu seem to still work. Things Ive done:- I removed the cmos battery for a while did the thing with the screwdriver.- My mainboard has a flashback button tried that with an usb 2.0 and a 3.0 FAT32 with MSI.ROM inside of it. I think it didnt worked since the red light only blinked 3 times then didnt came back- switched ram sticks and also tried out other slots with 1 stick and also with 2 sticks- waited a longer timer and just tried to turn it on- used other/new cables- cleaned dust- checked if anything is out of placeI dont have another psu but I dont see any reason why the psu should be brokenWhole PC is 1 1/2 year oldSPECSMSI MPG X570 GAMING PLUS / RX 6700XT / Ryzen 5 3600 (New one will be Ryzen 5 5600X since it was cheap and the old ryzen was bottlenecking) / Ram sticks are something from ballistix / PSU is from bequiet (Im asking for a friend)"

My plan is to go with the cooler as a top exhaust add at least one intake fan at the bottom and the case already has intake fans at the front and an exhaust fan at the rear.---Any (good) advice is welcome even if it's just a little bit. Thanks for reading this wall of text :P"
"My mobo only has two headers I have my exhaust fan attached directly to the board. However I wanted three intake fans at the front however I can only fit two 120mm fans but I could fit an additional 92mm fan to make the three. The two 120mm fans are 12v 0.23 amp and the 92mm fan is 12v 0.09 amp with the header being 1amp so no risk of overloading. Both 120mm are some budget ones from Amazon and the 92mm is a Nocta NF-B9 redux all fans have a max rpm of 1600 and all are 4pin. Would it work if I plugged them into a Y cable and had one of the 120mm as the master? Sorry if this seems a really stupid question but I've only ever split fans in the past that have all been the same. I've read online that splitting different fans can cause problems like a fan(s) not running after booting from sleep etc."

I got the deluxe version for early access and now I plugged in my laptop on my 42" tv and everything including the cut scenes was just plain laggy. Anyway I could play around the settings/drivers to have this run smoothly on my TV?Another option I'm looking at is that my 1050ti could be due for an upgrade.. Which card should be able to perform smoothly while plugged in on a 42"?Note: I am fully aware that there is a huge gap between my 5600x and 1050ti but for the past year I have no issues running my go-to games.For those who will ask my PC is too far too be plugged in my TV right now and I can't commit to re-arranging my setup now as the newer GPU (3050) underperformed already on the TV I think it would be too big an effort just to disappoint me later on.

"[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/v6WWqm](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/v6WWqm)so i finally got my new pc together and to be honest i'm really unhappy with it. when i got it i updated every driver i could got new firmware installed the latest bios chipset and so on and so forth. the first problem i have is my pc is \*extremely\* loud.i had pcs before and it was never this loud. and the worst is it's not just when playing games even in idle i can hear it clearly. i'm not sure why because the CPU cooler i got was described as one of the best and quitest. the PC case is supposed to be a 'silent' case and wasn't cheap. but this is the polar opposite it's so loud it gives me a headache. i tried to fix it by lowering the fan speed i put it on silent mode and it's still way too loud.the next problem is that i'm getting random freezes. my pc will freeze no error or anything the sound will keep going for a few more seconds then stop. i have to force shutdown because nothing is reacting anymore. i thought it might be because i was playing a game that was too intense (which really shouldn't happen with this setup to be honest what's the point in getting a gaming pc when it freezes from an intense game) but it also happened when i was playing league of legends which runs on 10 year old pcs. i have absolutely no idea why this is happening and it is extremely frustrating after spending so much money to get a solid pc. i'd be extremely helpful for any tips and help. i'll be sure to edit this post with things i've tried."

"I know this isn't a question about building a **PC** per se but it does have to do with a specific component so I thought you guys would be worth asking. If this doesn't belong let me know and I'll take it down. Thanks!I've got a bit of a unique problem and haven't been able to find what I need very easily so I thought I would ask you kind people for some advice. I have a 20m fiber optic DisplayPort cable that I use to play VR games in my living room about 10m away from my computer. I'm trying to use this same cable to play PC games on my TV because it is far and away the best monitor I own but it only has HDMI inputs.What I need to be able to make this happen is a female DisplayPort input to a male HDMI output (essentially taking DisplayPort male and outputting HDMI male) I can connect to the TV. Unfortunately everything I can find is either non-reversible mono-directional or is HDMI in to DisplayPort out. Do you guys have any adapters or setups you recommend for this use case?I've also got a DisplayPort female to DisplayPort female adapter that I use with my VR headset that I could use as part of this setup but I'm not sure how useful it would be as I'm trying to use as few components as possible to avoid potential points of failure.

I don't play the most graphically demanding games but stuff I play like Baldurs Gate 3 or No Mans Sky currently look/run like crap.Ok so go buy a decent GPU and I'm set?  Nope I guess HP systems are very difficult to upgrade!  Case is very small and the PSU isn't very strong either.So I think I might just have to start fresh and build a pc budget isn't too high right now could be more in the future so I was hoping to upgrade what I had and do further in the future. (Also my memory is 12gb but runs very very low on benchmark tests that might be a different topic.)It has a 1TB SSD with windows on it and the memory/processor 'should' be good enough to do what I need.Question is there anything wrong or not compatible with just buying a new case PSU Motherboard and GPU and using my old SSD Memory Processor? and then upgrading as I go?

I use the primary M2 slot for my OS secondary for games the 4TB EVO for all day-to-day tasks and all QVO SSDs for my Plex server media.So I have used a SATA to USB-C cable as a stop-gap to expand the library of media without removing any other drives. I have been reading about HBAs which can use a PCIE slot coupled with the right cables to expand my storage. The problem is my GPU takes one PCIE slot and blocks the second one leaving me with only one remaining PCIE slot which I was going to use for a dedicated sound card. Are there any other solutions here I'm not even sure I can share the third PCIE slot without reducing the bandwidth on the GPU.  The goal is to eventually move to a Lian Li O11 EVO XL which has a specific tray to hold 5-6 SATA SSDs but again doesn't solve the MoBo connection / saturation problem. I don't really want to go down the route of building a NAS right now but will do so in a few years from now. The reason this is happening is because I have converted most of my library from standard 1080P media to REMUX media which takes up significantly more space.Appreciate any help you can offer as I want to get at least one more 8TB drive into this monster. &#x200B;SpecsCase: Lian Li O11 D-XLMoBo: Z490 XtremeCPU: i9-10900KGPU: 3080 Xtreme 10GBRAM: 64GB (4 x 16GB CL DDR4 -4000 CL16)Storage - M2: 1 x 1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus / 1 x 2TB Samsung EVO PlusStorage - SATAIII: 4 x 8TB Samsung QVO / 1 x 4TB Samsung EVOPSU: Corsair AX850 850W 80+ TitaniumCPU Cooler: NZXT Kraken Z73"
"My build: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XB9fzf](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XB9fzf)Ever since I bought the NH-D15 and 3080 my PC has been acting strange. My temps for the 5600x seem to be worse than the stock cooler even with me reinstalling it twice following videos repasting dozens of times and undervolting. The CPU idles at around 45-50c (with max fan speed) which I would understand if I had a i9 or something but I have a ryzen 5. My GPU gets to 90c while playing very low end games like Rainbow Six at low settings. My PC will also freeze randomly; I think it may be a ram issue. I suspect that my fans may not be good enough for my parts. Can anybody tell me what is up? Any programs I can use to diagnose my issues? What do I need to buy?  edit: Fan config is 2 120mm's in the front for intake and 1 120 in the rear for exhaust. Heatsink has no sticker on it. I used arctic mx4"

"Hello.  I have a 3070 tuf gpu.  Everything seems to be ok with it 60-70 ºC while gaming.  But i dont know why every couple of minutes the temperature goes up to 90 ºC for a couple os seconds also the fans goes up to 3000 rpm.  Then after 5-10 seconds the goup goes back to its normal temperature.  I cannot reproduce it or do something that triggers it.  The only thing i realiced its that it happens more frequently when there is water in the scene.  I know its weird but  i dont know what to do.  Any ideas?  Thank you."
"HiI am currently upgrading a standard DELL business desktop with a GPU for casual gaming.The pre-built system (DELL Vostro 3668) only has a random crappy 240W PSU so I figured I'd look for a GPU that doesn't use a lot of power.So I picked up a GTX 750ti for 30 bucks on the secondary market. It has plenty of performance for my needs and more importantly has low power consumption (TDP 60W). [See here](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-gtx-750-ti-oc/23.html) > What I find surprising is that the card never exceeds 75 W power draw which the PCI-Express slot could provide alone. ASUS has also placed a 6-pin connector on their card which seems redundant because the card never uses that much power.CPU is i5-7400 (Max TDP 65W). System also has one 256GB SSD and 8GB of DDR3 which only requires 3W from my very limited research.Therefore I thought the PSU should be able to handle the GTX 750ti with ease. **Unfortunately I missed that the GPU still has that additional 6pin connector which this PSU doesn't provide. Both of its 6pin and 4pin connectors are used for powering to the motherboard.**  Is there still a way for me to connect the GPU to the PSU safely maybe by connecting it to a SATA connector on the motherboard (3 of them are not connected to anything)? I understand that this is not recommended but looking at the overall power consumption metrics I think there should be a way to make this whole thing work somehow.Does anyone have any experience with this?I'd appreciate any input.ThanksTL;DR: Cannot connect low-power GPU to PSU of pre-built DELL system because of missing 6pin connector."
"I used to have a problem with my old PC when playing games (in extremely rare ocassions it might have happened outside of games) where sometimes the entire computer would freeze for 3 to 10 seconds. I thought this was a RAM issue (I had 8 gb) so I updated to 32 gb and since I had to change mobo I also got a new CPU and CPU fan. So I have kept the PSU GPU an HDD and a SSD. With the new computer the freezes have "downscaled" to only affecting the game itself with the rest of the computer being usable. Since the CPU and RAM are new I would blame the GPU but this problem happens even when playing games with very little graphical needs so I am at a loss to where the problem could originate. Does anyone have any ideas?"

"Finished building yesterday and now I'm kinda shocked how insane the performance is? I saw plenty of YouTube videos about how the 2700x isn't bottlenecking the 3070 at 1440p or maybe just slightly but I am left shocked. The difference is anywhere from 40-100 fps In titles like Spider-Man remastered and Death Stranding and titles that ran like absolute stuttering messes such as Batman Arkham Knight and Ac Origins ( which are coincidentally some of my most favorite games of all time ) now run flawlessly. I can not stress it enough. The difference in smoothness and usability is truly breathtaking and I'm so very glad I decided to take the leap. I didn't test cinabench and programs like that since I mostly just game and those numbers aren't important to me. The usability of Windows also feels snappier and everything "just works". If anyone is even considering the possibility of upgrading from a 2000 series Ryzen. I wholeheartedly recommend doing so. I don't know if the difference will be as big with a 3060 or lower cards but if you have a 3070 please do yourself a favor.Edit: Forgot to mention RTX performance. It's staggering usually on the old Ryzen when I turned on rtx the fps dropped Significantly. On this one not only is performance hit lower it remains stutter free. I also had a problem with cyberpunk. It ran like trash and I had no idea why looked up how the 3070 performs on YouTube but the difference was mind numbing. Now I know why to say the least."
"I'm pretty far removed from the PC game worked in a shop a few summers like fifteen years ago but well that was fifteen years ago. My son was interested so I got us a cheap rig from FB marketplace. All good for a few months but I'm pretty sure the power supply just died. I pulled it ran the paperclip test no response. I think I've found the same PSU online however I'm curious if I can upgrade or find a better unit for the replacement but I don't really know how to determine what requirements the build has in regards to power.Here's the build as far as I'm aware (what the listing said on marketplace):Lenovo Thinkcentre M83.    Intel i5 4570.  Nvidia GTX 1650.  500gb HD.  120gb SSD.  16gb RAM.  The PSU in it is an HK380-16fpOne thing that confused me is I've never seen a mobo/psu that wasn't 24 pin. This has a 14pin and a 4pin which I guess isn't entirely uncommon I've just never seen it. Most of my experience was rebooting windows and swapping out fried parts in prehistoric nicotine stained  HP's. As well as calculating sales tax into the overall price and replacing the price tags for our weekly Tax-free Tuesday ""sale"".Anyways if someone could help me out I'd appreciate it this was technically a birthday present and I feel bad that she's out of commission but it's a learning moment for the kid as well the cool part of being into PC's is working on them yourself imo."
"I'm looking to do some upgrades to my PC build that will help make my strategy games run faster. I have noticed that a lot of strategy games I play (Total War series Paradox grand strategy series and Civilization series) run significantly slower than people I see play them on YouTube. I have gotten some suggestions to focus on my CPU and to look at the 5800x3d or the 7000 series when it comes out.

"I'm planning on upgrading some components but I'm stuck because of bottleneck problems.I use my pc mainly for video editing and gaming and my main priority now is to upgrade the cpu. I know 5800x3d and 5900x are strong options but the 5700x currently works better for me in terms of money. However I'm a little concerned about the gpu.I'd like something like from a 3070 to maybe a 4060ti-4070 when they're released as I'm not in a hurry for the gpu but I'm a little afraid that if I go for the 5700x I'll find bottleneck problems if somehow I manage to get for example a 3070ti.So... that's the question. Am I safe with the 7 5700x in case I get something more powerful than a 3070?Also for additional context my mobo is  a B450 Aorus Pro and I'm not willing to change it but I don't know if I should consider it. My monitor is 1080 (would like to upgrade to 1440 in the future tho) so I play on that resolution but I if I'm not wrong I could just set the games I play to 1440 to avoid bottleneck is it?Thanks in advance"

"Just ran cinebench R23 and CPU-Z benches for my 13700K.I had previously undervolted my CPU by entering the BIOS of ASRock B760 and altering the setting marked under "CPU Core Voltage/Cache Voltage" as offset by -50 mV.Everything was stable no crashes at all and I've been using it for a few days and XTU graphs for Max Core Speed and temps seemed perfectly fine.When I decided to download and run cinebench R23 and CPU-Z however the performance numbers seemed rather low. Ib fact for R23 it appeared to be as low as 33% less than what I saw reported as average (CPU single was around 1800 but multi score was only 18000).Set my Core voltage back to default and scores now for the R23 is 2820 and 28600. Substantial number differences even with the temperature throttling active now that my voltages were reset to default (multi core only).While I understand that not all CPU's are the same and some will lose the "CPU Lottery" these numbers seem hugely out of the ordinary given that I've seen statements that say people have undervolted by 100mV and saw no performance drop.a 100mV with no performance loss vs a 50mv undervolt and 33% loss seems a little too wide?Am I missing something?"

I want 7900 xtx because its VRAM will last long enough for me to buy a new pc in cca 5 years.I am from Czech republic so I would like to mention that I will only use components that are available in Alza (has price next to the name in search window and not just an empty field).My max price I will be aiming at is my current one but if you could find any component - except GPU and CPU - that I could spare money on I will be really happy.Thanks for your help!![PCPartPicker Part List](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/list/jrRZTn)|Type|Item|Price||:-|:-|:-||**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D 3.4 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/CZ3gXL/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d-34-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000651wof)|8790.00Kč @ Alza||**CPU Cooler**|[ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports DUO CPU Cooler](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/dmXnTW/arctic-freezer-34-esports-duo-cpu-cooler-acfre00060a)|1219.00Kč @ Alza||**Motherboard**|[Gigabyte B550M DS3H Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/VyBhP6/gigabyte-b550m-ds3h-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550m-ds3h)|2390.00Kč @ Alza||**Memory**|[Kingston FURY Renegade 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/Y9QcCJ/kingston-fury-renegade-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-cl16-memory-kf436c16rb1k232)|2349.00Kč @ Alza||**Storage**|[Kingston NV2 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/3QXJ7P/kingston-nv2-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-snv2s2000g)|2789.00Kč @ Alza||**Video Card**|[Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 7900 XTX 24 GB Video Card](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/RRfnTW/sapphire-pulse-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-24-gb-video-card-11322-02-20g)|29990.00Kč @ Alza||**Case**|[Zalman i3 NEO ATX Mid Tower Case](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/Qmstt6/zalman-i3-neo-atx-mid-tower-case-i3-neo)|1499.00Kč @ Alza||**Power Supply**|[Corsair RM850x (2021) 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/product/26rRsY/corsair-rm850x-2021-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020200-na)|3790.00Kč @ Alza||*Prices include shipping taxes rebates and discounts*||||**Total**|**52816.00Kč**|||Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2023-02-08 19:00 CET+0100|||&#x200B;"

" Hi allI've put together a bit of a sleeper build for my computer which I recently upgraded to MSI's z690 mobo range (specifically the Z690-A Wifi edition) . My GPU is a Powercolor 5600XT and I have 32gb ram with an intel 12th gen i5. The specs are totally adequate for my job as a designer / 3D tinkerer as I don't tend to do much gaming anymore.However - ever since this upgrade I've had pretty consistent issues with daily workflow. My computer sits in a bootloop for anywhere between 3 and 30 seconds before booting I get visual artefacts on the screen on basic apps like Blender and Chrome USB audio interfaces like my Volt 2 have interference and consistent skipping when listening to audio of any kind the list goes on. At first I thought it was a USB issue but that doesn't explain the GPU issues or the bootloop.Now I had a revelation today that it could be my placement of the GPU. It sits in the slot down from the 16x slot (the 8x one I assume) because my sleeper case doesn't allow it to sit in the slot above. I have a funny feeling there's some hogged bandwidth happening because this is a pretty unorthodox thing to do in modern builds but in theory there should be no issues right? A PC repair shop tried to re-create this issue minus the slot change and had no success so I'm pretty confident this is the culprit. But what confuses me is that according to my mobo specs all three of the usable slots for a GPU are 16x. Is there any kind of BIOS setting I can change to accommodate this placement and potential shared bandwidth issue? I am open to selling and buying a different motherboard with a slot in the place I need it (I don't think I know of any mobos with the primary slot being the second one down)."
"Hey guys. It's been over a decade since I was up to date on pc hardware knowledge and could use some help on where to focus on a pc build. Current system is running a 2500k with 16gb ram a 1050ti and an impressive 64gb ssd for windows/hdd for games. So you can understand the system is starting to show it's age.I play on a 1080p(60hz) monitor and I'm not looking to upgrade that. I mostly play quite low spec games like league of legends WoW osrs path of exile etc. so I haven't really needed to upgrade. Path of exile could use a better cpu for sure though. Thing is finally a game I'd like to play came out that I cant even run on low which is hogwarts legacy.Anyway sorry for rambling. I've looked around the used market here and something like a r5 3600 seems to go for 80e which seems like a fine upgrade for the cpu. As for the GPU I'm seeing gtx 970's at around 50e 1660s for 120e saw a couple 1080ti's at 200-250. For the SSD and ram I will just get the cheapest I can find (unless I should invest in good ram? I don't know).In total for cpu motherboard gpu ram and SSD my max budget is 400 euros but I don't want to use any money I don't actually need to. So the cheapest options possible is what I'm looking for. I'm also comfortable with overclocking. Since you guys can't know what's on the market here I know it's a hard question to answer but I figured maybe some of you might have good tips on what to focus the money on."
"With motherboards supporting (for example) 3.2 gen 2x2 with 60W PD (ASUS Z790-creator) for front panel hookups but cases still advertising 3.1 gen 2 or 3.2 gen 2 front panel IO I'm at a bit of a loss. I'm assuming 20Gbps and 60W doesn't actually work in a case billed as 3.1 Gen 2 but I have seen a few "cables are the same it should work" comments around.I'm struggling to find any relatively-authoritative info or at least some first-hand experiences with hooking 3.2 gen 2x2 with PD to case front panels.Anyone running 20Gbps (and/or PD) through front panel USB C?Edited to change 30W to 60W ... confused myself as I'm looking at a couple of different motherboards."
"So I’m deciding to build a new PC. Most likely will go with a ryzen 5 7600x/ ryzen 7 7700x .My dilemma is this. I was running a 1080 ti playing 1440 p for the last few years and I was doing great with it. Mostly play rocket league deep rock galactic and probably buy Hogwarts legacy. I’m debating on the new card. A friend of mine is willing to sell me his 3070 ti for 400. Or should I get a 6800xt? 6700xt?Or…. Just go balls to the wall and get a 4070 ti ? I don’t plan on upgrading the monitor anytime soon so I’ll stick with 1440 p for right now. What would you guys think? Or is there another car you recommend for 1440 P that has good price to performance? Also want to edit money is not a problem but I don’t want to spend a crap ton for a card that basically…I won’t be taking advantage of. Thanks 🙏"
"I have a new build I'm working on with a 4080 and my PSU is a Corsair RM850x. The 4080 comes with it's own connector that needs 3x 8 pin PCI-E connectors. My PSU only comes with two cables but one of them splits into a separate 8-pin connector. I think that's called daisy chaining? Is that okay for my card? It looks okay based on what I saw on YouTube and a couple posts here but I want to make sure before I break anything. So to clarify it would be 2 unique 8-pin connectors and then a third one that splits off one of the first 2."

"Hello everyoneI bought a new CPU recently and in order to use it I had to flash my BIOS. I am currently booting in CSM mode because the PC would never boot with UEFI and just restart to bios. I don't know if these issue are all connected or caused by different things so if you can only help with one of these then I would be thankful aswell.**My current list of issues/crashes:**BSOD somewhat frequently. Sometimes it's during games like World of Warcraft sometimes it's just when browing the internet. Can happen multiple times a day but there are periods when it doesn't happen at all. Just today it happened right after one of my chrome tabs died due to "not enough memory".As said above my chrome tabs keep crashing CONSTANTLY. This happens every day multiple times. Reloading the tab sometimes causes it to crash again. The error message is usually "not enough ram" or "Status access violation"Games crash pretty frequently but not to an extreme amount I would say. It was way worse a couple of weeks ago but got a bit better for some reason.

"I need an office/gaming chair. I'm posting here because if you're gaming on a PC you obviously need a good comfortable chair to sit in for hours. I have searched everywhere for a good chair from Staples to Amazon to Secret Lab. I find faults in all of them. I need a big chair that is super cushioned and comfy. I'm 5'5" 250 pounds. I am big but not tall so big and tall chairs are no good. I'm a woman and fairly girly so those executive leather office chairs are a big ick. I want something cute it doesn't have to be extremely out there just a cute color like a nice blue mint green teal no pink or purple though. So far Secret Lab looks the most promising but I've seen some questionable reviews about lack of quality and the chairs not holding up for very long. I want a chair that's going to last a solid 5 years before any kind of issues arise. I can't spend more than $500 on a chair because that's ridiculous. I'm on a budget. Any helpful suggestions would be very much appreciated."

" Hi allLast week I sent my RX 7900 XTX reference card from Sapphire to the authorized service for a replace. Main reason was it was overheating to 110 degrees Celsius would randomly crash while streaming. I did not know of the performance difference back then because I only had dual 1080P monitors. And given that AMD said that this was a known issue I thought that I would get a replacement pretty easily.Today I received my card back from the service with a note saying "The sound thermals and FPS values of the card is as expected" I said "oh OK it shouldn't be a problem then it must be a driver bug and will be fixed".When my card was at the service I upgraded one of my displays to LG C2 OLED which is 4K 120hz. I came back from the service with my card plugged it in fired up some games. I had a shitty performance I thought "oh bummer I thought that this card should handle 4K pretty easily" played a few titles.Then decided to check out how other people's 7900 XTX were performing. I was shocked by the performance delta there is.For Witcher 3 Next Gen I checked out 6 different benchmarks without ray tracing FSR and hairworks all of them had above 105 FPS constantly and would hit 120 FPS from time to time. I quickly changed my settings to match the benchmarks. I was shocked at my FPS values. I got a whopping 57 FPS at the start and then it thermal throttled down to 49. And all the cards on the benchmarks were running at 50-65 degrees with hot spot temps at 80-85 meanwhile my card was running at 80 degrees with 110-degree hot spot.I quickly checked other games and it was pretty much the same. No matter which game I would run the card would hit 110 degrees in 5 minutes then thermal throttle below 50% frames per second it should.And my card was hitting 65-70 degrees while I was watching stuff at YouTube.And the funny thing is the service still insisted on that my card was fine I recorded my tests to a video sent my card back to the service and will email them my tests as soon as my card is delivered to them.Let's hope that they replace it now. If they refuse what else I can do?"

What could be the cause of this? My motherboard is a B660m DS3H from Gigabyte case is 4000D airflow from Corsair and Arctic Liquid Freezer II 360(AIO). Based on everything I read before building this PC I thought I purchased everything well. (I know the motherboard isn't for overclocking but had to compromise)I looked at the power setting on Windows and changed it but It didn't make any difference. Max temp during the test was 95C.How can I diagnose what's going on?"

Arma 3 is...it's own beast but I tend to stick to single player stuff there.  Around 40-90 depending on the map mission planetary alignment  blood sacrifice etc.  I'm wondering if anyone has input on what kind of performance I can expect with my current specs at 1440.  TIA."

"I know this question is asked a lot and you're probably gonna tell me to google it. Believe me I did google it and have been googling it for hours but I'm so damn confused and since I'm new to this I can't make a decision. I have two options for a gpu. Rtx 3060ti and Radeon Rx 6700xt. I know in fps tests 6700xt seems to do better but they say that nvidia has better softwares driver updates and all. Also it has better ray tracing and nvidia's dlss is better than amd's fsr. And then there is the Vram situation. Some say 6700xt will last longer because it has 12gb of vram in opposition to 3060ti's 8gb. I'm not planning to upgrade my gpu for 4-ish years so there is that.

"HelloI have been asked by a friend to build him a PC as his old one has gone on to silicon heaven (motherboard failure). He will be keeping his current GPU for the time being (1660ti) and couple of HDDs everything else will be new. His requirements are 1080p gaming and possibly streaming. His old PC had a 2nd gen. i7 so anything recent will be a huge upgrade. With that in mind I am considering whether it's worth jumping on current generation hardware with r5 7600 paired with DDR5 or to stick with r7 5700 and DDR4 and save approx. $250.Going with new generation makes sense as he is likely to use the PC for at least 5 years and current platform would make it easier for him to upgrade parts in the future; However I am kind of hesitant seeing the mark up on the 7000 series AMD CPUs compared to the great prices of 5000 series considering the not that big difference in performance.[https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/list/GTGK9r](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/list/GTGK9r)[https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/list/PKWxJM](https://cz.pcpartpicker.com/list/PKWxJM)These are the builds I put together considering availability and pricing in my country. I am open to any suggestions for changes and mainly looking to confirm whether it's time to jump to the current generation despite the considerably higher prices.Thank you for any and all comments!"

I've connected the SATA cable with the PSU and I've connected a cable with the ADD_GEN 2_ port. I've looked into the BIOS but I can't see the fans. I guess they're not connected.

"Further context I built a PC back in May 2016 that had an i7-6700k 980 TI 8 GB DDR4 2666 memory. I added 2 more 4GB sticks of memory a few years ago so I'm currently at a 4x4GB kitLast week I upgraded my case to a Hyte y60 and my graphics card to a 4070 TI. Still rocking all the other parts from the 2016 systemMy original plan was to wait until Black Friday or cyber Monday sales this year to totally upgrade everything else in my system (mobo cpu cpu cooler possibly psu as well) but I am reading a lot about how even 16GB ram might not be enough these days for playing the newest games and having some background stuff open. I'm not too familiar with how much of a difference 2666 vs 3600 speeds would make but I know 16->32GB is theoretically a big improvement. Another variable here is that I was considering paying a bit more money to get DDR5 memory when that time came later this year rather than DDR4. Just so I'm a little "futured proofed" and able to take advantage of whatever DDR5 may be able to do a few years from now that DDR4 can't or is much worse at. Admittedly kind of ignorant on the potential benefits of DDR5 vs DDR4So basically what I'm asking for is advice on whether I should wait until later this year and buy DDR5 ram or spend about $100 now to buy a 2x16GB DDR4 3600 kit and reap the potential benefits for the next ~10 monthsI'm not some crazy tab hoarder in web browsers or an application slob but I do like having discord + spotify + a browser open with <5 tabs while playing a game. And of course with my new GPU I'll be able to play all the newest titles which I'm hearing are taking up more and more RAM"

If i wanted to keep it at 3600 and spend a little more to stop being cpu bound would the 13700 be a better match for it? id live to stick to i5 and save on ram but wouldnt mind knowing my options the other way.&#x200B;Lastly to be stable in this set up can i get away with running two identical 64 gb kits these days?

"My PC is getting kinda old. I'm running an i7-7700k and a GTX 1080 on a 165hz 1440p display. So I kinda need an upgrade for getting those smooth frames at high settings but I don't have enough money on me to build a completely new PC for now.

The other cores all passed. I repeated this test several times and it always fails on the AVX2 Huge or All test always on Core 0.I went into bios and added a positive curve optimizer to this core (+10) and could not get it to fail again.I'm still within the return window...should I go exchange it?"

"HiRecently built my first PC (been using laptops). The case is already mentioned. The CPU is 7700x + Noctua NH-D15 cooler. The 2nd fan of the cooler didn't fit so I've purchased 12x25 noctua fan to place it there. The GPU is Palit 3060Ti. Mobo is Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX.Now that I have one fan from the CPU cooler sitting in the box and since I don't have anywhere to place it but replace it with one of the stock front case fan is it worth it?If so should I replace the upper or bottom one if it matters? Is it worth buying 120mm fan for the back to help take out the hot air from the CPU cooler? If so I have only 'CPU_OPT' pin available is it fine to plug it there?I can also place fans at the top but I think they will blow out the hot air from the CPU cooler to the GPU.Currently playing Far Cry 4 at high settings I'm getting 67~ degrees on both CPU/GPU."
"So I recently switched PSUs due to strange crashing in certain games. The crashing problem seems to have been fixed but ever since the crashing my pc seems to boot up ”twice”. As I press the power button the fans will start spinning for a second shut off for maybe half a second and turn on. After this the pc will turn on normally. Is this something to be worried about and if so what might be causing it and how do I fix it? My new PSU is a 750W cooler master GOLD. My old PSU was an almost decade-old corsair 750W PSU.

"Hey there. Looking for an advice / tip when it comes to PC upgrade.Im currently running i7 2600k with GTX 1070; 24GB DDR4 1600mhz; sitting on an old MSI P67A-GD65.I am aware that they are nothing hot but I was wondering how much more I could potentially squeeze out of the 1070 at this point before purchasing something new. Cus afaik and from experience the 1070 is still decent enough to play new games @ mid setting but I feel like the CPU might ba a major bottleneck at this point? I was even looking up some YT benchmarks for some of thes games and was suprised by the FPS boost some games have compared to my setup with a different CPU. I am looking to fully upgrade in the near future but with the GPU prices as they are I'd rather sit it out for a little while..So Im wondering if theres a point and if you guys have any tips regarding possibly rebuilding my PC while lets say sitting on the 1070 for an extra month or 2..I dont really do too many "new releases" anyways so I'll be happy if you know upgrading everything besides the GPU right now will improve my experience playing the games I currently do like - Hunt Showdown R6:S and with a new GPU lets say 2 months from now I'll just seal the deal.Thanks in advance"

" I have built my first PC together with a buddy who had some prior experience. Ive put an rtx 4070 ti with a i5 12600k 32 gb ram and a 1 tb ssd together on a ASUS Z690M Plus D4 mobo.However the GPU didn't output HDMI signal on a 1440p 144Hz monitor at first and I had to connect it on the Mobo to access the BIOS and to flash it to the newest version. However after turning graphics to PCIE in the BIOS it kinda solved the problem but the GPU skips the motherboard splashscreen entirely and I cannot enter in the BIOS anymore not even in the UEFI troubleshoot menu it just boots up to Windows directly. Weirdly enough the Windows 11 boots up so slow in approx. 30 seconds which my friend pointed out that it's too slow for a WD Black SN850 SSD.What exactly could cause all of this? If I tamper with the boot mode in msconfig to boot it in safe mode the GPU signal is lost again so whenever I try to use the BIOS/any other thing which is outside Windows I have to connect the HDMI to the motherboard."

I would like to switch it for a liquid cooler namely the Arctic liquid freezer ii 240 argb as that is one of the best performing 240’s money can buy.

"My new PC was built with the H100i Elite Capellix and it is... noisy to say the least.I'm currently using a mod (just an edit of the config) to bring it down to 1970rmp which is bareable but still loud. I remounted just to make sure that wasn't the problem but if anything it sounds louder now. I could barely hear it after setting the mod up yesterday but now it is pretty clear - just nowhere near as annoying as any other setting. I'm not going crazy from it when the room is silent anyway.I don't think the problem is air bubbles but rather the fact that it resonates against the mounting/something else. If I push on any of the four screws or on the front of the pump (although this is less effective) the noise is effectively halved at worst. It is definitely not the fans or the rad.It's i7-12700k Asus Z690 Plus if that is of any relevance.I know that others have had similar problems with noise there's a 19pg thread over on the Corsair forums starting from two/three years ago! But I couldn't really find any other suggestions on ways to dampen the noise or information from people who decided to stick with it despite the noise apart from the mod.Any suggestions I could try before I decide whether to RMA or put up with it? Anyone who kept it despite the noise? Is it likely to cause damage? Thanks!"

I'd probably be looking at an additional 300 out of pocket for the upgrade (will be searching on hardwareswap etc...) but the main question is whether or not that increase in VRAM is REALLY that big of a difference for the 300 upgrade or if it's better to just hold off a couple gens.Thanks and sorry for the dumb question!"

"Hello! I need to build a PC that its main use will be creating and rendering 3d graphics on Cinema 4D.The person that requires it already has a PC that uses : Nvidia GTX 1650 an i5 9400F 2x8gb Kingston 2666mhz RAM DDR4 on a B365M DS3H. Its a bit slow since the GPU has only 4gb of RAM and they want to upgrade to something that renders much faster.What is the best build? I heard here that NVIDIA cards are the best for work/professional use and I thought about using a 4070Ti 12gb since its 1000 Euros whilst the 3090 goes for almost double that here and since its performance is similar to the 3090Ti albeit it has lower RAM capacity.I have no clue as to what build to follow i dont know how important CPU is in this specific program they will use.What is the cooling required for such types of work around 3d graphics?Thanks in advance!"
"So just did my first build.Due to availability I've used the "K" even if I didn't planned to do any overclocking*.*should have thought that through since I probably need undervolting and overclockingIdle temperatures seems ok but as soon as run any test it runs very high.So I need to do some investigation and try to improve. Here is what I think I should at least do:- redo the thermal paste and redo the cooler again.- add contact frame.- add a exit fan in cabinet- add a second fan on coolerWhat I've done:- under voltage core offset with -0.075V in BiosBut since this is my first build I'm doing a lot of guessing and need some inputs!This is no way is ny extreme build so I'm sure I've messed up somewhere.Here is my specs:1) Core i7-13700K CPU LGA 1700 16-Core 24-Threads  2.5/5.4 GHz Raptor Lake2) Noctua NH-D12L 3) ASUS TUF GAMING B760M-PLUS WIFI D4 (mATX B760 LGA 1700 DDR4)4) Inno3D GeForce RTX 3060 Twin X2 LHR - 12GB GDDR6 RAM5) 128GB DDR4 Patriot Extreme Performance Viper 4 Blackout Series6) GIGABYTE P1000GM 1000 Watt - 120 mm - 80 Plus Gold 7) Samsung 990 PRO 1TB SSD PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.28) Fractal Design Torrent Compact Black TG Dark TintI know the B760 probably was a mistake.. Needed the Bluetooth it was on the cheap side and didn't want to go for DDR5 since DDR4 is fast enough for my use and DDR5 is expensive in some quantities 😅I do not game so I have not checked any temperatures in-game.I do like my PC quiet and watercooling isn't the best in this case (and as a new builder water+pc scares me 😱)My Cinebench is sub 30k for multi core (28952)My IXT bench is 9732 (5.35ghz/100C). As said it hits 100C in a milliesecondSo pleas if ANYONE has any input to a completely noob pleas let me know!"
"Hi! I recently build a PC for the first time and its not really my expertice area so I am seeking some advice. To a certain point everything seems to work but then I have started to experience crashes when playing games like the witcher 3 and also a few times when working in blender. I have tried to update drivers and have run the windows memory diagnostics tool which does say that there are hardware problems detected. Ideas I have are that the BIOS needs to be updated or that there is something wrong with the RAM. Am a bit nervous to update the BIOS though in case it crashes. How do I get further in figuring out what the problem is?The parts used are:GIGABYTE X670 Gaming X AX Motherboard - AMD X670 - AMASUS GeForce RTX 3070 Ti ROG STRIX OC - 8GB GDDR6XAMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU - 8 cores 4.5 GHz - AMD Am5G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 BK C36 DC - 3Windows 10 BIOS version F2 12-09-22Thanks!"
"So as the title says approx. every other time I boot my PC up it gets stuck on the startup page where you can press F2 or DEL to enter BIOS. This comes along with my HDD making a strange noise (I've opened the case to locate the sound and it's very clearly coming from the hard drive). I have an M.2 SSD with my Windows installed on it which I've had no problems with so far. This only started happening the last week and I decided to come here for some help. This noise coming from the hard drive only comes whenever it gets stuck in this state it's quiet when Windows does boot.As far as solutions go I've cleaned the inside of the case tried unplugging USB-dongles and plugged the hard drive in and out. Still it gets stuck on the same screen about every other time I boot it up. Would appreciate some help! Current solution is just shutting it off and booting back up whenever it happens and I'm fine the hard drive doesn't make any noises when Windows actually boots and it's all good.

"On Black Friday after saving up some money from working during the summer I decided that I would upgrade my GPU from my RX 570 to an 3060 Ti. I bought the MSI Ventus 3060 Ti from Microcenter for $410 and picked it up the same day. After playing some games I noticed that there wasn't much of a difference in performance for most games I played (like Overwatch R6 etc...) and Warzone was still stuttering. I believed my Ryzen 5 2600 was bottlenecking the GPU so I ran some benchmarks but that wasn't the problem.Worse the quality of the card was poor and I have to put up with coil whine from my GPU from time to time. It makes a very annoying noise while running games under medium-to-heavy load. The XFX RX 570 never had the problem I have now.I honestly regret upgrading my PC's GPU. I didn't see an issue and it only caused a lot of stress for me. I was considering returning the GPU but decided against it. Maybe it's simply buyer's remorse since I'm a broke college student.Additionally: I use a 1080p 165hz monitor that i bought after upgrading because I heard it'll make a difference. I used DDU when changing from AMD to NVIDIA drivers.I use 2x8 3000mhz ram sticks."

"I updated from windows 10 to 11 a few weeks ago when I had done a clean install. Used it for the trial period then after the option to revert back was gone I began running into an issue where the mouse pointer will not be displayed. It happens on the first boot of the day. The mouse still has power the brand logo is still illuminated. It's still working. I can see it highlighting icons or the minimize/close buttons on an open app. I've tried moving it to another USB port but still does it. I have to restart my PC and then it works fine. I haven't tested if it's solely the mouse. But it's not really easy to test because after I've restarted it once it doesn't hide the pointer again until it's been powered off for 10+ hours. I went through the pointer options and verified it was all good. Hide pointer when typing is not enabled. I went through and reinstalled the mouse driver. There really isn't much online as to what's causing it. Is there something obvious I'm missing? Anyone got any ideas?I apologize if this is not the place to post. I posted to /pchelp and /techsupport no responses."

"I'm trying to figure out how to comfortably play my PC which is on the other side of the room on my tv. I like my couch and a lot of the time my wife enjoys watching me play single player games. I also like keyboard and mouse and I will be making a lapboard for that.I'm thinking the best way to do this will be a kvm but I'm not very familiar with them outside of your basic on the desk "plug it all in to both and away you go" setups.I'm going to need something that will switch from my wired keyboard mouse and monitor to my tv and wireless keyboard and mouse. The run is about 75feet so I'm guessing it'll have to be fiber.Any recommendations on how to do this? Am I barking up the right tree? Or is there a better alternative out there for this?Obviously the "easiest" way would be game streaming. However I cannot stand the input lag that I've experienced trying it in the past. All my devices are wired too and even still it's a problem.So outside of building a whole separate computer I figure getting my cables around the room is the next best thing."
"Hi quick tip cause I was just freaking out for an hour over this and only found this answer buried in a forum:If your new build doesn’t show anything on a monitor try with a regular tv (I used an old non-smart tv) and it’ll show. Chances are if you’re slow and careful you connected everything correctly - make sure the ram cards are in the proper slots as per your motherboard instructions because they are not in order.Hope this helps someone!"

"Edit: issue is still unresolved but some progress has been made after following a users comment to prevent windows drivers from overwriting the official AMD ones I can now access the internet without the display going out however it still goes out when attempting to install the official AMD drivers online research suggest PSU could be an issue but after running a stress test (that multiple suggestions online said would fail if the PSU was indeed crapping out) there was no issues and my PC continued to operate "normally"Been having a strange issue with my PC the past couple days and figured id post it here cause im stumped.My GPU started giving no signal after booting up It would show the splash screen and I could enter bios with no issues but as soon as it would normally go to the page where I sign in the display would cut out (the PC is booted and working in the background and I can hear sounds like the chime when you add/remove a usb device for example theres just no picture)I figured dead SSDs/RAM or GPU mightve been the issue from what I read online but after finding one of my old HDDs i never wiped (was in my build before I upgraded to SSDs) I removed both my drives (2x 1tb M.2 nvmes) and inserted the HDD and the display worked perfectly normal again. At this point I wiped both my SSDs by deleting all partitions on them and booted with the HDD as the boot drive and it still worked fine (albeit slow asf) so I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic (which said it detected no issues) then opened Samsung Magician and it said both SSDs were in good health but I wasnt %100 if magician is accurate when it comes to these kinda things so I decided to download crystaldiskinfo and thats what brings us to the part that has me stumped...Roughly 2-3 minutes after connecting to the internet the HDD (with which the display was working perfectly fine for 3+ hours offline) all of a suddenly stopped showing display and now has the exact same issue as my SSDs even when the HDD is the only drive in the PC (display works through the boot process but cuts out at the login screen)Any help would be greatly appreciated as I have no clue wtf the cause of the issue could even be at this point and have been unable to find anything online about someone else having this specific problem so far.All my suspicions have either been ruled out by testing or I'm not sure how they could relate to the HDD working fine for a while but coincidentally just so happening to come down with the exact same issue after connecting to the internet Also worth noting this is not a new build and I havent changed any hardware in roughly a year and a halfSpecs are: CPU: Ryzen 5 5600xGPU: RADEON RX 5500 XT MECH 8GB OCSTORAGE: 2x 1tb Samsung 980 NVME SSDsMOBO: Asus B550F gaming (non Wi-Fi version)RAM: 4x 8gb corsair vengance DDR4"

"thinking about addig blutooth and wifi to my pc  is usb adapter as good as pcie?  thinking to use usb for future proof"
"As the title suggests I have an older PC I'd like to upgrade. I built this PC roughly 7 years ago and while it's an absolute beast of its time it's unfortunately limiting my abilities to enjoy some of the newer titles. Additionally I'm a developer and while my current work supplies hardware in the past (and possible distant future) I might once again need to use my own machine. So here's what I'm working with:  CPU: i7 4790K @ 4GHz  GPU: Gigabyte GTX  980  MEMORY:  Kingston HyperX Fury 16 GB DDR3 @ 800mhz  STORAGE: 970 EVO+ 2TB  MOBO: MSI Z97 Gaming 7  PSU: EVGA SuperNova 750  CASE: Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower  DISPLAY: LG HDR QHD 32" (2560x1440@59Hz) So where I stand right now my build is all over the place. I have a mobo that is getting older with RAM that is two gens behind but also a surplus of power with an enormous case and a monitor that way out classes the setup. As it stands I can't really prioritize 1000$+ towards a full makeover with a new mobo CPU and RAM. So what I wanted to know was does it make sense to upgrade my GPU and if so what would be the ideal option? My current budget has a soft limit of 500$ but could possibly be raised if the performance-to-value is really exceptional. Looking on UserBenchmark it looks like the highest value-to-performance in my range is the RX 6600-XT but a 35% increase in performance seems meddling for nearly 300$. The RTX 3070 on the other hand is nearly a 90% jump in performance but seems that it's still priced over its MSRP on newegg and amazon. Additionally I'm not entirely sure if this will be bottlenecked by my i7 as it is an older model. This is a lot of questions but thank you nevertheless for reading through this and hopefully helping me decide. If I forgot any key pieces of information please let me know."

" Hi guys  I have built recently my new pc with mostly all Asus Rog item as below specs and everything works great temperature are extremely low and build is stable without any problem but I'm having 2 small issues.First is that my fans always run in normal mode and every start up I need to open Armoury crate and set it to silent (mobo and gpu are reaching barely 35 degrees) is it ppossible to change it or can be fixed somehow?  The second issue I'm encountering is that the following RGB lights randomly rainbow color cycle every in a while for few seconds then go back to the original color set in AURA sync - static white. This is happening in any circumstances (gaming working idle watching videos) and it's completely random while it doesn't seems to be related to any performance issue or cause any it is pretty bothering me. I'm using armoury crate and I've tried to reinstall it but without any luck looking around for a resolution but wasn't able to find any. Did you guy have experience any of it or any possible resolution?  Specs:  Asus ROG B550-A Gaming - no rgb  Rog Strix LC II 240 ARGB white edition - logo doesn't reset - 2 fans attached to the radiator yes  Cooler Master MasterFan MF120 Halo White Edition ARGB (Back fan) - it's affected and reset the rgb  Case df700 flux with 3 argb fan front - affected  Gskill Royal RGB 8x2 (not affected)  mouse ROG Impact - not affected  Keybord Rog Moonlight - not affected  now the only thing they have in common is the rgb controller connection which comes with the case included.(it's attached to 5v rgb addressable on the MB)  Does any1 know what could be the solution? thanks! It's so random and unpredictable and last 2 seconds max that I didn't make any videos 📷Thanks 📷"
"Basically the title. I've upgraded my rig over the past few months the only thing that isn't new is the power supply. I bought it in 2017 a corsair VS-650. It served me well but it only has one PCI-e cable with a 6+2 daisy chained connector on the end. My 2080 however can pull 225 watts and I read that a pci-e cable is generally rated for 150w max so it isn't ideal.I have the opportunity to buy a FSP hydro G pro 1000w power supply for relatively cheap (\~170 usd same price as most 850w psus) meanwhile the ATX 3.0 psu market here is almost non-existent (east europe) and like double the price per watt.I don't intend to buy a 4080 or 4090 in probably the next 5-6 years especially since amd is relatively cheaper than nvidia so I doubt I'll ever need the 12vhpwr cable. But if I do I theoretically could get psu-to-gpu (not adapter) cable from cablemod or something.I have read mixed opinions on here and on pcmasterrace some calling it a godsend some calling it a scam. The posts I read are months old so I thought I'd ask what the general consensus is."

"Hi I'm building my first PC and was hoping to get some advice. My two goals are gaming + ML. I mostly only play Valorant + League of Legends so the gaming specs required aren't that high though with a real PC instead of my current Macbook I'd potentially branch into games that require more extensive rendering. My current monitor is an LG 32-inch 165Hz with 2560x1440 resolution. I also do research in an ML lab and while any real work I have will be done on remote servers I'd like to have the ability to run small experiments on my own hardware. From what I've experienced most libraries have the best support for Nvidia hence the 4070Ti. Overall I've read up and tried to get mostly solid budget parts that I think will still remain at least mid-tier for a while since I'd rather avoid frequently upgrading but if there are any obvious upgrades that would feel much nicer + won't break the bank I'd really appreciate suggestions as well. For the CPU in particular I'm not sure how to choose between tradeoff in # cores (often running parallel code) / clock speed / price.

"So i recently bought a new prebuilt PC with a i9 13900k and 4090 so it generates quite a bit of heat im aware you can have 3 more fans at the top of the td 500 mesh as my radiator for my cpu cooler h150i elite lcd corsair is at the front and they only put in 1 exhaust fan at the back of the case. The issue is i wanted to put in more exhaust fans but they have installed the cpu cooler so it blocks the top of the case where the fan bracket is the cpu cooler wires are brushing against which is annoying. I can change it but i would have to rewire it all which seems like a pain if its not going to help temps that much. I can add one more exhaust in the top corner by the other exhaust fan should i do this or leave it as 1 exhaust 3 intake? Temps have seemed fine so far when playing games hottest ive seen the gpu is 72 and cpu like low 80s all at stock. Also should i get 2 120mm or 2 140mm as exhaust fans if i get 2."

"Hi everyoneAMA.  But real quick a brief overview.In 2010 I was working as a software engineer on a team of people rewriting an optimizing dataflow compiler.  We were doing performance and functional testing and wanted to build a cluster of machines to parallelize the testing.  To get the most of our budget I offered to build the test machines.  I put together spreadsheets manually entering in price/performance/capacity data to find what would get us the best bang for our buck.  As I was doing that I thought that the process was tedious and there should be a site to do that.So in April 2010 I started working on a side project to plot those CPU price-vs-performance and hard drive price-vs-capacity curves.  I wanted to learn Django and Python better.  My HTML at the time was 90s-ish at best - layouts done with tables and 1x1 transparent pixels not CSS.  I bought a $20 admin theme off themeforest and wrangled it into what I needed.  I'm colorblind and not a designer by any stretch and that showed in the site.I started evolving the site to not just plot component curves but factor in compatibility checks.  I was building new PCs every 3-4 years and each time it involved coming up to speed with what the latest architectures and chipsets were.  That took time and I felt like part of that process could be automated.Late December 2010 after a heads-up about this community on HN I [posted in /r/buildapc for the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/promos/comments/ec5nl/pick_parts_build_your_pc_compare_prices_and_share/). When I first started I told my wife that there was a monetization opportunity through retailer affiliate links and if we were lucky maybe we could go get coffee or see a movie.  I left my job to work on PCPP full-time over eight years ago.I hired /u/manirelli a bit over seven years ago.  /u/ThoughtA also joined us over four years ago.  (Both those guys are here to answer questions too).  They handle all of the component data entry community engagement and a host of other things.  They're amazing.What started as price tracking a few retailers in the US is now over 200 retailers across 37 countries processing hundreds of millions of price updates a day.  Brent is the guy who handles all of that and Jenny manages those retailer relationships.  It's a ton of work and I'd be lost without them.Not to leave anyone out but huge thanks to the rest of the team.  Phil (you can thank him for all the whitespace lol) AJ Daniel Jack Barry and Nick.  You all rock.  I'm incredibly blessed to get to work with all of you every day.This has been such a ride I can't explain it.  I've felt so incredibly blessed to be able to be a part of this community and what it does every day.  Thank you.-- Philip-With all that being said AMA.  There may be some things I can't comment on if they involve agreements or confidential terms.And yes we're working on an app.  A PWA.  May go native later but no guarantees.  I hope to have it out by Christmas.  I had hoped to have it ready by today but it's just not there yet.**EDIT**: Holy comments batman.  Gonna try to answer as many as I can today."
"Last Saturday I posted about building a gaming computer for my son for pretty much just Minecraft.  I had $300 to work with.  I expected a few replies and a few pointers.  The response to that post was unbelievable.  I woke up the next day and my wife told me she needed to silence my phone in the middle of the night.  Over 40K views and over 300 replies.  I now know the meaning of RIP inbox.  I got a lot of great advice from a lot of people.  In the end it was pretty clear.  I could build it for $300 but it wouldn't be great.  It may play Minecraft but that's about it.  I would be better off spending more money on a build and well my wife and I didnt really have more money to put towards it.Let me start by saying I was messaged by quite a few of you about graphics card mother boards processors that they had laying around. Willing to send them to me for nothing or maybe some shipping.  The generosity of this sub is amazing.  I was never looking for anything but advice and many of you offered many things.  For that I am very grateful.Then I was messaged by a member of this sub who wishes to remain anonymous.  They offered to purchase a WHOLE BUILD for me.  They said they were around my son's age when they got into building computers and technology.  They now work with computers as their profession and wish they could have shared a similar experience with their dad growing up.   I was skeptical to say the least but they were very genuine in their message and honestly I don't know how I could have said no.Over the next few days we sent messages back and forth and he put together a build for my son and I.  My wife kept telling me its crazy and someone was messing with me.  I stayed a little skeptical but I could tell through the conversations we had that this person was truly a good person looking to make a positive impact.As of last night all the parts were ordered and are being shipped straight to my house.  They have sent me order confirmations as well as tracking on all the parts for the build from Amazon and Newegg.Here is the build:[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Qybxyf) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Qybxyf/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [AMD - Ryzen 7 1700 3.0GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3kPzK8/amd-ryzen-7-1700-30ghz-8-core-processor-yd1700bbaebox) | $279.99 @ B&H **CPU Cooler** | [Noctua - NH-U12S SE-AM4 CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7dTrxr/noctua-nh-u12s-se-am4-cpu-cooler-nh-u12s-se-am4) | $59.90 @ Amazon **Motherboard** | [MSI - B350M PRO-VH PLUS Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qys8TW/msi-b350m-pro-vh-plus-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b350m-pro-vh-plus) | $56.98 @ Newegg **Memory** | [Corsair - Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2skwrH/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3000c15r) | $204.99 @ Newegg **Storage** | [SanDisk - X400 256GB 2.5" Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vyKhP6/sandisk-internal-hard-drive-sd8sb8u256g1122) | $97.99 @ B&H **Video Card** | [MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB DUKE OC Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/49YWGX/msi-geforce-gtx-1080-8gb-duke-oc-video-card-gtx-1080-duke-8g-oc) | $514.98 @ Newegg **Case** | [Fractal Design - Focus G (Black) ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ZHmxFT/fractal-design-focus-g-black-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-ca-focus-bk-w) | $54.99 @ SuperBiiz **Power Supply** | [SeaSonic - FOCUS Plus Gold 650W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WrNypg/seasonic-focus-plus-gold-650w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-ssr-650fx) | $83.99 @ SuperBiiz  | *Prices include shipping taxes rebates and discounts* | | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1363.81 | Mail-in rebates | -$10.00 | **Total** | **$1353.81** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-12-06 18:00 EST-0500 |All I can say is that it is truly a Christmas miracle.

"It's not perfect and there have been a number of times that I haven't been able to find a specific part(that I know exists but they don't have it in their database) but it's a wonderful tool that has saved all of us an unimaginable amount of time in the building process. I mean imagine a world without it.You have to double and triple check all compatibilities look through all the different retailers for the lowest prices write down build lists yourself. Calculate the TDP make sure your graphics card isn't too long and your CPU cooler isn't too tall.They do all of this for you and more. They let you store multiple lists and post finished builds. And you have all of that saved online where you can access it anywhere.Best yet I heard they're working on a website overhaul to make mobile use more fluid.I want everybody who sees this to take a moment to remember how valuable PCPartPicker has been to all of us. For free. Because they believe in the cause.Edit: of course they make their money somehow but they don't charge us for their servicesEdit 2: Happy New Year!!"

"I'm not an "Intel fanboy". I'm not an "AMD fanboy". I'm a fanboy of my bank balance. People *none* of these companies care about you; they care about their profits and their stakeholders.Now on to the topic. YES Ryzen is an EXCELLENT platform. It really is and it really has brought the competition that benefits the end user. But this does NOT mean we should be saying *"oh there's like no competition Ryzen is better value hands down"*. This is NOT true.The 3600 vs 10400 vs 10400F is an excellent mid-range example of this.If I posted on this subreddit and asked for a mid-range build most people would recommend a Ryzen 3600; and that's great! It really is an excellent value CPU. But what people fail to realise is that **so is the i5 10400F.** Both are 6/12 CPUs and both offer VERY similar gaming performance indistinguishable to the to the end user if you played a few games using both CPUs.The problem with recommending only a 3600 and not pointing out that the 10400F has very similar performance is that people will not even bother checking the price of a 10400/10400F. If the 10400F is cheaper than the 3600 why would you *not* get it?Sincerely from someone whose friend bought a 3600 over a 10400 for video editing on Adobe Premiere Pro because "AMD is better for productivity". For those who are unaware Adobe Premiere Pro greatly benefits from Intel QSV in both timeline scrubbing and rendering times. A 10400 will destroy a 10400F and a 3600 in Premiere Pro (with HW acceleration ofc). Worst part is the 10400 was on sale on $299AUD where I live compared to the Ryzen 3600 costing the normal $349AUD.Edit: number of downvotes really speaks for how much people don't like listening to logic and sticking with the AMD good Intel bad mentality.Edit 2: Wow this blew upEdit 3: Yes if the Ryzen 3600 is cheaper than the 10400F then get that! That's my point they both perform the same get whichever is cheaper.Edit 4: I'm honoured my gold award cherry has been finally popped"

"I'm not going to preach to anyone about the dAnGeRs Of VaPiNg. I do it constantly all day long. I get it you vape bro.I recently built a PC using Corsair's Spec Delta RGB case and bunch of LL 120 fans in a front to back airflow configuration. The case has been left with the side panels off as I've been constantly troubleshooting issues with this build from GPU failure to a B550 board not allowing me to control my own fan LEDs. I've been vaping like an idiot next to it the whole time. **THIS IS NOT WHAT MESSED UP THE FANS**When I go to clean things out the dust is sticky almost moist in most places. I can see droplets forming around the rim of my AMD Wraith Prism cooler. It's from all the moisture being put into the air when I exhale the vape.

"I bought 2 copies of Windows 10 Home OEM from Newegg.com for $85 each on sale.  This is consistent with genuine OEM pricing around $100.  They emailed me two copy/pasted keys.  Both failed to activate Windows so I called Microsoft.  They checked the keys and said both were pirated!  This is not a genuine Microsoft product!I contacted Newegg.com and was transferred to a supervisor.  They refused to replace the keys with verifiably genuine Microsoft products and refused a refund.  They did offer to email me more pirated keys(they called them digital but could offer no evidence they were anything other than what Microsoft said). They refused to acknowledge that Microsoft confirmed Newegg.com’s keys were pirated constantly trying to say things like “I’m sorry you weren’t able to get your keys to work” or “I can assure you that all of our keys are genuine but they don’t always work.”   Fact check;  Microsoft has already confirmed these were pirated keys.  As for them not always working?  49% of Newegg’s reviews for this item are 1 Star...nearly all of them saying the same thing...the keys don’t work and Microsoft says they are no good.  Wish I’d noticed that before I bought...which is why I am here actually.  Don’t make the same mistake as me.  I’ll be disputing the credit card charges and I’m optimistic since Microsoft has my back but what a hassle!By the way I just bought a ton of hardware from Newegg that works fine.  If it didn’t I’d be in trouble because they are notorious for not RMAing bad components but everything I bought was stuff I’d be comfortable taking straight to the manufacturers.  7 dead pixel minimum to return a monitor!? Sometimes the deals aren’t worth dealing with a company like this.  Definitely not the place to buy software or easily counterfeit goods.TLDR; Don’t buy software from Newegg.com.  They sold me pirated windows keys that don’t work and refuse to replace them with genuine products or issue a refund."

"#Guide to Setting up Windows 10 & Maintaining your PC ^^Updated ^^4/22/2020This is assuming you have successfully completed your PC build and are wondering what to do next. Here’s a few helpful tips I have learned over the years. **Warning:** Yee who don't like opinions probably don't dare enter..&nbsp;**Windows Installation:**Download [Windows Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). Create a USB installation drive using the tool and boot to the drive by changing boot order in your motherboard UEIF/BIOS.Start the install choose “Customize Settings” and turn everything on this screen off. Proceed to install Windows with a local account. If you're okay with Microsoft collecting some data you can always sync your Windows account later in **Settings > Accounts**. The benefit being Windows will backup your settings and can sync them with other PCs you own. Once you boot up head over to **Settings > Update and Security**. Check for updates and go grab your favorite beverage and let it complete you may reboot multiple times during this step.Once you're done updating go to **Start > Settings > Privacy** and go down [the list on the left](https://i.imgur.com/FZ8TqkW.png) and turn everything off unless you actually use it. * Same goes for background apps -- only disable apps from running in the background that you don't want notifications from. It's safe to disable background apps completely if you don't care.* Under "Feedback & Diagnostics" switch that to "Basic". Once that is done head to **Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Delivery Optimization** and turn it off. That setting allows P2P updates across your network which is a potential security risk.* Next head over to **Settings > Network and Internet > Wi-Fi** and turn everything off here besides the Wi-Fi itself. Having done all of that correctly you have disabled the bulk of data logging background app usage and diagnostic feedback. Yay! Windows is installed. Much of what you do next is personal preference (appearance software customization) but there are a few things I would like to recommend.&nbsp;*****Quick accessibility tip - Open Control Panel and at the top-right change "View by:" to "Small icons". It will make more sense following this guide.** ***&nbsp;**Update motherboard BIOS** - If everything is working properly and you are happy with the performance of your PC - It is generally not recommended to update the BIOS as there is always the potential for something to go wrong. That being said if you follow the installation instructions **exactly** from your MOBO manufacturer you will be fine. * For all BIOS and firmware updates I will refer you to your manufacturer’s support page to ensure you are getting the latest and greatest. Follow the instructions there for how to install (typically downloading the update to a FAT 32 USB drive and flashing the update in your UEIF/BIOS). &nbsp;**Drivers:** Windows 10 will automatically update and install drivers for your hardware via Windows Update. This is typically fine for everything except your GPU and chipset which we will take care of next. &nbsp;**Update your graphics card driver** – Again head over to your manufacturer’s website and follow the instructions there to install:AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)NVIDIA - [http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)&nbsp;**Update your chipset drivers:** - Chipset drivers are a set of operating instructions which tells your CPU how to behave and interact within your PC. Typically these will come with a optimized power plan for your CPU which you can enable in Control Panel > Power Options. AMD - [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)Intel - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005533/software.html&nbsp;At this point it may be a good idea to grab [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) (also in the Additional Tools section below) to check the internal temperatures of your CPU GPU etc.. to make sure nothing looks out of the ordinary. If anything appears abnormal you can try reapplying the thermal paste to make sure you have adequate coverage. As far as where temperatures should be. That will differ drastically depending on your cooling solution (air water AIO passive) ambient temperatures overall case airflow and cooling performance of individual hardware. Generally if you are idling and your CPU/GPU is near or under 45°-50° you are likely doing just fine. &nbsp;You can also test your ram by using Windows Memory Diagnostic. Just type **Windows Memory Diagnostic** in to Windows search and it will come up. You will be required to restart your PC to test. When you are done head to **Event Viewer > Windows Logs > System** and the results should be the most recent log (at the top). If it's not filter for Event ID 1201. &nbsp;**Change refresh rate on monitor** - If you have a 144hz or 120hz monitor and either a DisplayPort HDMI 2.0 or DVI-D (Dual-Link) connection it’s a good time to look at your refresh rates. If you own an Nvidia card change it in Nvidia control panel. For an AMD card follow these steps:* Right-click your desktop and choose Display settings* Scroll down and select Display adapter properties* In the properties window click on List All Modes* Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply**Note:** If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat steps above. &nbsp;*****Edit:** Ehh.. Thinking back I would just ignore this part. The firmware your drives ship with are just fine. It's not worth it just leave it alone. ~~**Update your SSD firmware** - This may be a new concept to those coming from an HDD but your SSD’s firmware can be updated as well. To begin head over to your manufacturer’s support page (yes again) and to ensure things go smoothly I recommend downloading their management software. If you just purchased your SSD you will more than likely find it is already updated. They are not frequent so if you're not concerned feel free to skip this step.~~~~• Crucial offers their “Storage Executive Management software” and Samsung has “Samsung Magician”. If you own a different SSD search its support page and see what they offer.~~~~• Crucial offers a “Momentum Cache” feature which speeds up your drive at the expense of using RAM and the potential for data loss. I go into more depth on it [in a previous post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7mf8yo/reminder_your_ssds_firmware_can_be_updated/). Personally I’d leave it disabled if you’re happy with its performance and your workload doesn't demand it. For normal gaming and office use you won't notice a difference. Samsung offers a similar feature called "Rapid" and while I have not used it personally I would say my opinion on it stands.~~~~**Warning:** Some manufacturers may format when upgrading. *Please* **READ** the instructions carefully. I am not responsible for any data loss.~~ [Crucial Firmware - USA](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/support-ssd?cm_re=us-support-_-main-_-firmware-update-link)[Samsung SSD support page](http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/download/tools/)&nbsp;*****Anti-virus/malware:** This can be a polarizing subject for some and I can only offer my experience but after years of searching and experimenting this is what works for me. I will also preface this by saying depending on your browsing/download habits this can change entirely. Ultimately my best advice on the subject is: #Do your research and find what works best for you.That being said I use the following and it's all available for free… **Anti-Virus:** Windows Defender – For me Windows Defender is good enough. It’s simple and FREE. Stay vigilant and let it run on its schedule scans and build its definitions scan periodically if you wish.**Anti-Malware:** Malwarebytes Free/uBlock Origin – Again the free version of Malwarebytes is good enough for me. While browsing uBlock will do the bulk of your malware blocking and if you suspect anything got by run a Malwarebytes scan. I run Malwarebytes every couple of weeks personally for peace of mind.**Firewall:** Windows Firewall. While behind a router there isn't much use for a soft Firewall it is good for protecting yourself within your own network. E.g. if another PC on your network gets infected it could prevent your device from contracting the virus/malware. It is also useful to create outbound rules for preventing certain applications from accessing the internet if you don't want them too. &nbsp;**Additional Plug-ins for safer browsing:*** [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) - Privacy Badger stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - HTTPS everywhere rewrites all web requests to use HTTPS wherever possible. * [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) - NoScript is an open source add-on that allows JavaScript Java Flash and other plugins to be executed only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).&nbsp;**Additional configuration:**Malwarebytes:* Go into the settings and enable “Scan for rootkits”.uBlock Origin:* The default settings will block 99% of ads and malware but if you want more protection/AD blocking/annoyances filtering head over to **uBlock settings > 3rd party filters**. I enabled all uBlock filters (except Experimental) all “Ads” filters (except mobile) all “Privacy” filters all “Malware Domains” filters and all “Annoyances” filters. I’ve never had any issues browsing or viewing content while using these settings but to each their own.  If you have issues you can always reset to default on the settings home page. There is said to be a drop in performance if you are doubling up on items in your lists but if there is it's negligible and I haven't noticed any. Other than that the worse that can happen is that you increase the chance of rendering a page incorrectly. Not a bad trade off for peace of mind while browsing.&nbsp;*****Performance Monitor:**Windows should be mostly configured at this point. I'd recommend running this report to see if Windows detects any issues or has any suggestions about your current setup. If you receive passing grades on everything pat yourself on the back. If you received a fail or warning don't panic just read the suggestion and follow the instructions on how to resolve it:1. Open a 'RUN window' by pressing the 'Windows key + R'2. Type **perfmon /report** and hit Run3. Wait and check your results&nbsp;I like to routinely check **Reliability Monitor** just to see how my system is doing day to day. It will report any critical errors or update failures so you can well... see how "reliable" your system is. If you go 5 days without any critical errors reported than congratulations you have a very healthy system. Also keep in mind the extent of the error reported. If Malwarebytes crashing shows up as a critical error or crash I don't think that's a good representation of your system health. Some stuff is unavoidable Windows isn't near perfect. Along with Reliability Monitor keep an eye on **Event Viewer** to track any errors you may come across. It should be your first step in troubleshooting issues. Ignore any "DistributedCOM" errors. They've been around since Windows 8 and everyone gets them they're harmless. &nbsp;**CPU Overclocking:**There is a huge community behind overclocking and while it can be fun to eek out extra scores in benchmarks it honestly isn't worth the hassle of the average PC user. On modern Ryzen and Intel chips algorithms have been built into account for this and will automatically clock frequencies up and down depending on thermal performance. If you bought a CPU in 2018 or later my opinion would be to just let it do it's thing. &nbsp;**XMP Profile / Overclocking RAM**Enable your XMP profile in BIOS so your RAM can run at its rated speed. There are too many different boards and ways to do this so just type your "motherboard name + XMP Profile" into Google to see how to do it.*****Maintenance/Upkeep:** Windows Disk Cleanup. Nothing against CCleaner but it's unnecessary and deletes valuable Windows Defender files. Also it comes with a registry cleaner which **shouldn't be used for any reason.** Realistically if you're not pressed on hard drive space or experiencing issues there is no reason to run a cleaner of any kind. If you run Windows Disk Cleanup just understand what you are cleaning before you check mark it for deletion. &nbsp;**Registry:**Your registry is essentially a Windows database that informs your operating system and applications how to behave and appear. That being said  **Don't use registry cleaners**. While CCleaner is harmless when used correctly messing with your registry always creates the potential for harm. You will never see any measurable performance increase from using a registry cleaner.If you know what you are doing the registry is a fantastic tool for making UI or OS changes (e.g. removing the "3D objects folder from File Explorer removing OneDrive etc...). As always just make a backup first.&nbsp;**Defragging your HDD** - Probably don't need to do this often once every month or so or after very large frequent file writes. FYI Windows automatically sets a schedule to defrag your HDD every week by default.  To change the schedule or run it manually go into **"My PC" > Right-click your HDD > Properties > Tools > Defragment**. Analyze the drive and if it's over 10-15% fragmented considered running the defrag.**Do NOT use third party tools to defrag your SSD.****Note:** The native Windows 10 defragger is smart enough to know this it won't give you the option if you try. Instead what you will find is that Windows does a version of defragging once a month by default called 'Optimizing'. You can read a really good article about it [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx). In short don't worry and let Windows do its thing. &nbsp;**Backup:** I use Windows Backup and Restore. I'm sure there are more comprehensive tools out there some 3rd party ones which were suggested below but there really isn't anything more comprehensive than creating a system image. You can do this by navigating to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > Backup and Restore (Windows 7)**. Once I have set up Windows to my liking I create a system image and store it on an external drive or a secondary HDD preferably both. Do it periodically if you have the space. You will thank yourself if you ever run into an issue and need to restore from an image. You can also use the Full or Incremental backup feature but I prefer just to have a system image on hand in case of a failure. Backup all of your important files and documents to the cloud so they are safe from system coruption and accessible across your devices. Google Drive is a great tool. * A system image is an exact copy or clone of your drive in that particular state when you created it. You can use it to restore the system after a catastrophic crash hard disk failure etc...* A Full Backup contains data files but not everything on the disk. You cannot use it to restore the system.&nbsp;**System Restore:** Go to **Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > System Protection**. Chose your C: drive and click "Configure...". Turn on system protection and choose a percentage of space you have to spare. 5% is typically more than enough. Use this option if you ever have an issue and need to restore to a particular point in time - before a faulty Windows update for instance. &nbsp;**UPS:** If you can afford to buy one buy one. For those who don't know what they are UPS stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. I own two APC models I got from Amazon and living in Florida they've saved my ass during many o' thunderstorms power outages brownouts and surges. Keeping a steady flow of electricity to my PC it's good peace of mind to have. If you are wondering it is okay to plug a UPS into a quality surge protector like the Tripp Lite Isobar 2 home UPS devices typically don't have high joule ratings (surge protection). &nbsp;**Physical Maintenance:** I'm sure everyone has their own routine for this step and depending on where your PC is located it may require more frequent cleaning/dusting. Always keep pressurized air (duster) handy. Once every few months or whenever you notice a dust build-up open it up and blast it. **Hold your fans in place so you are not spinning the blades this can generate an electrical current and potentially damage your circuit headers**. I would avoid using any sort of vacuum attachments as there is a good risk of damaging your components. For tempered glass use a microfiber cloth to buff out any smudges. Glass cleaners are safe to use on tempered glass but I would still dilute them so your mixture is half-water half-cleaner. Other than that find a nice cool place with good airflow to keep your machine running smoothly. &nbsp; *****Extras (optional steps):****Calibrate monitors** – Windows has a color calibration tool built-in. Or if you’re lucky enough you will find a guide for your specific monitor. Just do a Google search for “Calibrate + Your monitor model” and see what kind of information is out there. Tom’s Hardware had a good one for my AOC and I have noticed more defined colors since doing it.  **Enable High Performance power plan** - Go to Control Panel > Power Options and choose the "High Performance" plan. **Disable “Enhance pointer precision”** – Go to Control Panel > Mouse > Pointer options and uncheck “Enhance pointer precision”. This will give you more control over your mouse while gaming. You can read more on it [here]( http://www.thewindowsclub.com/enhance-pointer-precision-windows).**[Disable Cortana](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/features/how-to-disable-cortana-on-windows-10-1683223)** – I don’t know who uses Cortana but it annoys the hell out of me. **[Disable OneDrive](https://www.howtogeek.com/225973/how-to-disable-onedrive-and-remove-it-from-file-explorer-on-windows-10/)** - Only if you don't use it I prefer Google Drive. **[Disable Fast start up](https://www.howtogeek.com/243901/the-pros-and-cons-of-windows-10s-fast-startup-mode/)** - If you have an SSD disable this. It will not affect restarting your PC but when doing a shutdown it will not reinitialize drivers meaning any driver related issue you were having before your shutdown will persist when booting up the next time. u/agent268 has a very informative [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4x7n41/psa_disable_fast_startup_to_force_windows_to_load/d6dghtm/) on it. **Disable Remote Connections**  - Go to Control Panel > All Control Panel Items > System > Remote settings and uncheck "Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer". Below that select "Don't allow remote connections to this computer" if you are not remoting in to it.  **Turn on Dark mode** - Right-click your Desktop and select "Personalize". Select "Colors" on the left scroll to the bottom and select dark. [Makes it much easier on the eyes](https://i.imgur.com/zqTFowh.png). &nbsp;*****Additional tools of the trade:*** [CrystalDiskInfo](https://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskInfo/index-e.html) - Check drive status and health* [HWiNFO64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/) - Hardware monitoring program that reports basically ever sensor your PC has to offer: voltages temperatures fans speed etc...* [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) - Display information on Processor name and number codename process package cache levels.

(u/wittywalrus1) **I have used Macrium Free personally to clone an SSD and it went very well I have not tried the others. As always do your research.**&nbsp;I'm not going to include information on going buck wild disabling services and data logging because what I mentioned above is sufficient for me but if you feel inclined you can search yourself and find some good posts on the subject. I don't recommend using the SpyBot tools because they modify system values and if you're going to do that you should learn what you're doing and modify it yourself in case something goes wrong. In a recent Windows update they provided the ability to delete your stored diagnostic data in Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback > Scroll down to "Delete diagnostic data" just take it with a grain of salt as to what actually gets deleted. If you've stuck around this long I love you."
"I’m seeing so many posts about getting a 3090 for gaming. Do some more research on the card or at least wait until benchmarks are out until you make your decision. You’re paying over twice the price of a 3080 for essentially 14GB more VRAM which does not always lead to higher frame rates. Is the 3090 better than the 3080? Yes. Is the 3090 worth $800 more than the 3080 for gaming? No. You especially don’t need a 3090 if you’re asking if your CPU or PSU is good enough. Put the $800 you’ll save by getting a 3080 elsewhere in your build such as your monitor so you can actually enjoy the full potential of the card."
"*Update* Thank you for all the comments below. I've tried to include as many tips and fail safes you have mentioned in this post. I do recommend people read the comments as I may have missed some.Firstly thank you to this excellent community my PC is now built and working (pics to come in another post). I thought here are some lessons I learnt in building the PC researching and other bits I thought would be worth sharing as a lot of this I never had even heard about. Some will be obvious and others less so. I should note that I'm not a pro or someone who does this regularly just someone who spent a while reading around so feel free to correct/highlight any mistakes and I'll try to update the post. The descriptions aren't really meant to be a full lesson about each part and will be lacking a lot of detail but are more a jumping board for further reading if anyone is interested. For full information on building a PC I highly recommend looking around on YouTube and other sources.If I get anything wrong please correct me and I'll update.On Monitors:1. If you are after 144Hz 1440p gaming use a Display Port (DP) cable not a HDMI if you can. As you could be hampering your refresh rate ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming))*Update* Although you could be fine if you are using HDMI 2.1 see link for more details 2. Freesync vs Gsync. For simplicity both these technologies aim to match performance on screen with your GPU. Freesync works with Radeon GSync with NVidia (although some Freesync monitors will be GSync compatible likewise for the otherway around). It's complicated and due to changes in the standards over the years it can vary from monitor to monitor. Make sure to do research on the specific monitor you're wanting to get/have. If you are buying a new monitor keep this in mind. [https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/entertainment/g-sync-vs-free-sync-explained)*Update*According to comments freesync monitors will almost always work with Nvidia. As always do read around about it.3. Windows by default is set to have a refresh rate of 60Hz if you have a higher spec monitor you can change this to match your monitor in "Advanced Display settings".RAM (All except point 1 was completely new to me)1. 2 Sticks of 8GB Ram will perform better than 1 stick of 16GB Ram ([https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/](https://techguided.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-vs-quad-channel/)). Also when installing them put them in the correct channels check your Motherboard for details.2. Your motherboard will prefer your dual channel RAM to be in specific slots. I had an issue where I couldn't get the maximum performance of my RAM which I had placed in slots 1 and 3 but the moment I put them in 2 and 4 it worked perfectly. Check your motherboard manual.3. Enable XMP in Bios (This might also be called DOCP or A-XMP). This will vary between motherboards but if you don't your 3200MHz ram is likely running a lot slower. In my build XMP wouldn't work till I put the RAM in the correct channels hope this saves someone the hours I spent finding this out ;) *Update* You can use Task manager to verify you have done this correctly.3b. Someone pointed this out XMP may void your CPU's processor (https://community.amd.com/t5/processors/xmp-profile-ram-3200-mhz-and-amd-warranty-policy-for-ryzen/td-p/145798) (https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/XMP-Warranty-void/td-p/1196241). If anyone knows any more please message me directly so I can add the details. This was mentioned by someone in the comments and I would rather pass the information and ask you to do your own checking as well.4. When picking RAM frequency matters but so does CAS Latency. You want high frequency but low CAS (CL) latency. I'd recommend doing more reading about it if you want to know more I'd recommend doing some more reading but the "true latency" can be calculated as TL = CL \* 2000/Freq. E.g. CL 18 3600Mhz Ram has a TL of 10ns.*Update* Someone who actually knows what they are talking about found point (4) confusing if not perhaps misguided and I recommend you read their post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtdudd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)5. Ensure the speed of the RAM is compatible with the board you are looking to purchase (or visa versa).6. Motherboards will have Qualified Vendor Lists listing RAM they have tested and certified to work. This may be worth looking at. Just because your RAM isn't on the list doesn't mean it won't work or won't overclock it just means it hasn't been certified to so do take this into consideration. (I found this in my build while it was from Crucial and some Crucial RAM was on the QVL mine wasn't. Thankfully it was fine.)Motherboards1. Newer processors (e.g. at time of writing many AMD motherboards require a bios update for the 5000 series AMD CPU) may require you to install a new BIOS before they can be detected. Not all motherboards can have their bios updated without a CPU installed.  When shopping for your motherboard looking to see if it does USB Bios flashback should be considered. This was completely new to me and glad I learnt it in time.\*Addition\* Newer motherboards don't require bios updates and so won't need this feature though you will have to check.2. Different mother boards are compatible with different CPUs pick your CPU first3. CPU coolers may need different mountings depending on the CPU. When picking your cooler keep this in mind you may need to ensure there is an adaptor.*Additions from the comments*4. Not all mother boards have connectors for front IO USB-C. If this is important to you and part of your case it's worth looking into.5. Using an M.2 usually disables some of your SATA ports. If you are planning on using all your SATA ports make sure to check to see if this happens and how it happens on your chosen mother board.6. Some motherboards are built with Debug LEDs now that will help you diagnose problems.7. If you are after RGB effects ensure your motherboard is compatible with the effects you want to add. There are 5V and 12V headers so make sure they match. I'd recommend looking into this more yourself as I've likely vastly oversimplified. (https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?110272-What-do-5v-and-12v-RGB-cables-look-like-you-ask#:%7E:text=You%20can%20also%20see%20theas%20shown%20on%20these%20photos)CPU1. Some CPU's have integrated graphics. If you don't want to buy a dedicated graphics card you need to purchase one of these CPU's. You then plug your monitor into the motherboard.2. CPU's have a Thermal Design Power if you are not using the stock cooler read up on it (https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/tdp-thermal-design-power-definition5764.html)Component compatibility1. Make sure all your components are compatible. PC Part Picker ([https://pcpartpicker.com/](https://pcpartpicker.com/)) is generally pretty good at this. If uncertain this is a wonderful community to ask.Power supply1. PC Part Picker gives you a good idea as to how much power your system will need if not check the graphics card you intend to buy. Not all machines need a 1000W behemoth. Picking the right one will save you money2. Power supplies come with a rating standard e.g. Bronze+ etc... this is basically their efficiency. ([https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean36721.html](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean36721.html)). I think it's safe to suggest people should at least go for Bronze.3. Make sure your PSU fits in your case. I bought an ATX PSU then decided on the 011 Dynamic Mini case only realise it needed a SFX (smaller) PSU. I ended up going for a different case. Likewise an SFX PSU may not have the cable length you need or fit as snuggly in an ATX case (source: comments section)4. Look into the build quality of the PSU. A faulty PSU can cause serious issues down the line so it is worth taking time look at PSU Tier lists and review. (Link provided by several commenters https://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/)Tools (OP Note: I've only tried Ninite)1. Ninite ([https://ninite.com/](https://ninite.com/)) Is an easy way to download all the basic programs one tends to install onto a fresh Windows install without having to go to 10-15 websites. E.g. you can select to install Chrome Zoom Steam OpenOffice all from one installer. If you keep the install it can also be re-run to update all the software in one swoop.2. Patch My PC (https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/patch_my_pc.html) Patches software on your PC (Thank you to the sys admin in the comments for this.)3. Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) A powerful command line way to install and upgrade software.Storage1. M2 drives can be SATA or NVMe NVMe is faster. (M2 drives are generally plugged directly into the mother board for anyone who until recently was using a hard disk drive and considered SSDs "fancy")2. I highly recommend reading this comment (https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/kis9r5/lessons_i_learnt_the_longhard_way_so_you_dont/ggtn00w/?context=3) as it contains stuff I was unaware of.Case1. If your case has bottom intake or exhaust vents don't put it directly on carpet as it can block the air flow.  (Yup....I did need to be told this \^\_\^ my previous computer just didn't have any bottom intake hell it hardly had any intake).2. Make sure your mother board PSU GPU and all your components fit in the case. This is particularly worth noting if you are going for a micro ATX or a ITX case. Worth noting is to remember to include fans + GPU length any additional length caused by radiators (if you water cool) the size of your CPU cooler (if you air cool)*Additions from the comments*3. When considering your case if you are water cooling "Room for 2x 140mm fans does not always mean room for a radiator as well". Make sure to double check the clearance. Measure twice buy once. Advice on building (Notes and horror stories from the comments)1. Many new coolers come with pre-applied thermal paste. If yours doesn't don't forget to apply it to the CPU (See videos by people with more experience/knowledge than me on what to do).2. Remember your mother board I/O shield (advice from the comments about making sure to put it in before you install the motherboard mine came with it attached).3. Make sure the CPU is correctly installed before you clasp it down.4. If your motherboard has two slots to install a GPU. One of them (normally the top) will provide better performance. Make sure to use the correct one.5. Make sure your CPU cooler doesn't block a RAM slot. In making my PC the AMD wraith has a notch on one side with the AMD logo thankfully I put the RAM in first so I swiftly learnt that I had to rotate the cooler 180 degrees to get it to fit.6. If you can avoid it do not build your computer on carpet (and do not stand on carpet when building) and be aware of static when building. If this is your first build do some reading around this. Wear a static bracelet and attach it to something grounded.7. Remember if you have a dedicated graphics card. Plug your monitor into the graphics card not the motherboard.8. If you are installing fans make sure they are in the correct direction.9. When playing the radiator of your AIO (if you are using one) make sure part of it is higher than the pump (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGomv195sk)10. It's often worth the time to read the motherboard manual.11. This may sound silly but cables and the sockets on the PSU are often labelled. Be aware of this it will help you in the build.More subjective advice1. I've been recommend by numerous people to go for Gold+ PSUs with often being stated that while its more efficient it will also be better made. Your budget may dictate otherwise. If you look through the comments you will frequently find the advice "don't cheap out on the PSU and go for at least Gold"2. For most users if your CPU comes with a stock cooler. It will be good enough. You can always change it later. If your planning to overclock you likely know more than me so feel free to ignore. *Update* According to the comments AMD stock coolers tend to be considered good enough Intel not so much.3. A LOT of people below have said "Do not mix cables from different PSU manufacturers." as they are not universal. I don't know anything about this so do some additional reading if you are considering doing so. *Update* From further comments this is something to take serious. *Update* from further comments the word of advice is "Do your research before using cables not supplied with the PSU you are using."Further notes from the comments: Below are points I've read in the comments that might be worth drawing to people attention. Please read around the topic if it applies to you.1. One person has said XMP causes their Oculus Rift to do weird things.Hope this helps some people. *Addition* I recommend reading the comments as many people have put in their own tips/horror stories ;)Take care all and Merry Christmas."

"title :)  Thanks for any insightEdit: holy crap so many comments! Sorry if I can’t reply to them all but know that I am happy for your reply’s!Edit2: holy crap I didn’t think I would receive this level of support thank you all!"
"Last week I was discussing with my mom about my PC and mentioned that it's good enough for me but it lacks some RAM. Then she wanted to surprise me and actually bought  me some RAM even if I didn't ask her. Then today she came home with these beasts.[Picture of RAM](https://lensdump.com/i/0KcqM1)Yes it is 2 sticks of 16 mb RAM 16 fricking MBEdit: Now my most upvoted post is about 16 mb of ram noice"
"There is no component today that will provide "future-proofing" to your PC.No component in today's market will be of any relevance 5 years from now safe the graphics card that might maybe be on par with low-end cards from 5 years in the future.Build a PC with **components that satisfy your current needs** and be **open to upgrades down the road. T**hat's the good part about having a custom build: you can upgrade it as you go and only spend for the single hardware piece you need an upgrade for&#x200B;&#x200B;edit: yeah it's cool that the PC you built 5 years ago for 2500$ is "still great" because it runs like 800$ machines with current hardware.You could've built the PC you needed back then and have enough money left to build a new one today or you could've used that money to gradually upgrade pieces and have an up-to-date machine that's my point"
"Hey guys I am a PC noob and I have been here about a week. This whole time I thought real mining companies were buying these gpus and melting them down for a specific metal or something. It took me a week. :(-edit: damn there's way more people here than I thought. I just woke up I will start reading these."
"I had someone who I thought was a decent friend build a new PC for me. He was super willing to help and I thought I was getting a good set up.After having some issues on PC I decided to check out my specs further  I bought 9th generation I7 but a 4th generation was installed. I bought a msi motherboard but an older gigabyte motherboard was installed. Different/older ram was installed. Older ssd was installed. I was brand new on the PC world when I got it but now I know I don't have what I paid for.Before I tell him how disappointed I am in him as a friend and human being and cut him off is there anything else I should pay attention to?Thanks a lot.Edit - thank you everyone for your tips advice and support. It really helps. It's going to create a clusterfuck within multiple friends it's hard to get into details and am hesitant doing so online. I will be looking into small claims court now. It will not be ignored. I have not contacted him and don't think I should at this time.I will update this post and small claims court results when things are more settled.Edit 2 (8/6) - Thank you buildapc community!!! With your support I got refunded the money spent on all products I didn't receive! I developed full evidence and learned the process on small claims. I then contacted him to give him an opportunity to make things right. He was respectful and said it was an honest mistake during multiple builds and he refunded me. Hopefully he can learn from this mistake on his future builds as well as myself on due diligence in PC building. I am now looking forward to researching and building my new PC!!! Thank you buildapc community we did it!!!"
"Would your PC be here without it?  It's not the best but deserves more popularity. Whether it's figuring out how much power a GPU takes or wondering if that new CPU Heatsink fits into your rig. Pc Part Picker has your back and mine.   I Don't wanna keep you to long but think about this post for a little while and tell me what you think."
"That is all."
"This is really for everyone not just 1st timers... but it seems like were entering some dark times lol... Friday there was a mass "restock" of 5800x and GPUs (not the new cards but 5700xt to be specific)... I thought this was a sign of some sort of stabilization. I wake up today getting ready to start teaching and just casually check Micro Center to see if they have any worthwhile Cyber Monday deals (I live in Chicago so technically I'm blessed with two locations)... ALLLL of those 5800x that were available Friday and Saturday gone... all of those 5700xt and just about every other worthwhile GPU gone... now maybe its just cause it was Black Friday but I have NEVER seen MC not have any worthwhile GPU in stock. I look and all I see is one Liquid Devil each at both of my local stores... &#x200B;Maybe I'm being skeptical but it seems like were about to go into a Gaming PC Dark Age lol... I'm already seeing 5700xt getting resold for $700+ because they're now just "gone." 1st timers whatever you do... and typically I don't care how people spend their money... but do not overpay for any of these CPU's/GPU's ... just wait for the restock or 2021 like most people. That "Dream Build" is not worth burning an extra $300-$500 for one part.Edit: Wow! When I woke up and posted this I did not expect any of this. It’s sad that this is the current state of the PC world; CPUs and GPUs both now seem to being bought up at an alarming rate. I’ve read a lot of replies throughout the day and saw a lot of great takes from the “vets” and also newer folks in the community. This isn’t the first time that this happened and there are definitely a few different factors in why it’s happening right now. The one true positive we can say is that once these parts become readily available we’ll all be owners of PC tech that has taken a HUGE leap in performance. Hold out and weather the storm everybody don’t give in to the scalpers!"
"Hi. I am Colby and I am 10 and just finished my first build. It will not power up. I disconnected everything reconnected and tried again. Still nothing. My Dad and I bought everything using PCPartPicker and their compatibility checker and then bought from NewEgg. Here is my parts list:* . Intel Core i3-6100 3.7GHz Dual-Core Processor . * . Asus H110M-E/M.2 Micro ATX LGA1151 Motherboard* . G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2400 Memory* . ADATA Ultimate SU800 256GB 2.5”Solid State Drive* . Sapphire Radeon RX 470 8GB NITRO+ Video Card* . Deepcool DUKASE V2 ATX Mid Tower Case* . Corsair Builder 750W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply* . Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit* . OGEAR GWU735 USB 3.0 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter* . Thermaltake Riing 14 RGB 3-Pack 51.1 CFM 140mm FansI followed all instructions read every manual. My dad made me do a book report on every component before I could buy it so I thought I knew what to do. i used the anti static thing on my wrist during the build watched all the you tube videos and I dont know what else to do. Thanks for any help.UPDATE: So it was the 4Pin power supply. We were using the wrong cord for the Graphics Card (the 8 Pin) and once we switched them around we got fans and beeps. We had unplugged alot of stuff so we will work on it in the morning. Thank you to everyone that helped us!"
" Just as an FYI and a 'don't bother with Cooler Master sponsored giveaways'. I was one of the 'lucky' winners of the [r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/) 5 million subscriber giveaway. I was to receive the ML360P cooler.Firstly the mods of this sub have been amazingly supportive. Anyone who is on their back over this - cmon lets not. It's completely out of their control.Secondly - we have all been waiting for months now. It took a month and a half for Cooler Master to reach out for contact details and after collecting my personal info have ghosted me.Finally - I have been nothing but cordial and polite with everyone that I have had communication with including Cooler Master directly the Cooler Master representative and (especially) the mods of this sub. I've not been pushy or aggressive I've just enquired and requested.I want to implore the community to be wary of offers deals events videos and giveaways which are sponsored by Cooler Master. Having poked around the internet I have discovered that this is not the first time this has happened and likely won't be the last.I was lucky. I only lost out on a new CPU cooler (though I admit a big big upgrade). I am aware of people who 'won' other giveaways and then spent money on hardware to support their prize only to not receive the prize.Not cool Cooler Master. Not cool at all (kinda like my CPU... ;-) ).*Edit* FINAL UPDATEI am pleased to say that I have now received the package from Cooler Master unpacked installed and set everything up.While the original issue shouldn't have occurred once someone else over in their community team was made aware of the issues they were very quick to resolve the problem.  I've made a separate post about it but wanted to update this one in case anyone was still looking at it.  Pics of the gear and the build below:https://imgur.com/a/ZBFlkmP"
"So I am an enthusiast. Long story short my gaming rig took a power surge that killed the GPU CPU and board right before the GPU crazy and we had just moved. I was rather broke. Lost a i7 and a 2080ti. Managed to snag a Ryzen 5 3600 and b450 pro board and a zotec 2060 as everyone was dumping in anticipation of the 30 series. Fast forward almost 2 years. My now wife is… not a gamer or PC savvy at all. But she knew I was not happy with the 2060. We have a guest bedroom and I was looking for more storage one day (I work from home she does not) and came across a bag in the closet. LO and behold a gigabyte 3070ti. Her email is still logged into my iPad (we both have access to each other’s) I did a quick search and saw she won a Newegg shuffle a few weeks back and got this card for me. Had NO idea she knew about Newegg let alone the shuffle. It’s as close to a 2080ti as I am getting anytime soon. I love this women so damn much. Now I need to keep it down till Christmas. I have to rethink my own gift now to match hers better. Don’t want to one up her she wins this Christmas as far as I am concerned. But definitely some extra extra thought going into her gift.Edit: grammar crap.Second edit:  I have had some asks on the 2060 it is being donated to a friend of mine who lost her 1060 recently. She is also my dungeons and dragons group DM so I miiiight be trying to win some brownie points for the next time we encounter a Billy badass.Last edit: Card was most assuredly for me. I might have acted like a little kid again opening my Nintendo. My wife is amazing."
"I don't know what sort of strange 'luck' this is but I was very close to not ordering the new card.Edit answering some common questions since I'll probably stop replying to them now.* How did it die? The PC shut off randomly after launching FH4 and won't turn back on with the GPU installed. Also tested this in another PC and the same thing happens.* How did I get the 3070? Join Discord Alert servers be patient and prepared to pay over MSRP if you want one now. Otherwise ride out this madness.* What are you doing with the dead card now? I'm not selling it I plan on keeping it as a nice show piece for my office as some people have suggested and putting it in some sort of frame/ shadow box. Will post an update once I do this :)* Will the 3070 actually arrive? Yep it should do I just got notification that it has been shipped. It seems that manufacturers aren't getting out the lower end cards as quickly as the higher end so that could be why your pre-order is taking months.Also thank you all for sharing your stories and the conversations I've tried to reply to everyone who's commented but I woke up to 200+ notifications this morning so I will have missed some people sorry!Happy GPU hunting and may your old cards serve you well."
"Hi friends of Reddit I need help. My son wants to build a pc. Now normally when it comes to things like school work and life I usually have great advice and give pretty good direction. Right now though my almost 15-year-old son knows light years more than me about computers and desperately wants to build his own. I’m honestly totally down for it. His love of and natural abilities related to technology will lead him to amazing possibilities in the future. The problem for me is that this stuff is pretty expensive and I have no idea how to guide him or what he is describing when he speaks “computer” and I want to be able to give him good advice or at least make sure he’s not getting bamboozled when he makes his first purchases. Where does someone like me start to learn the basics and then the intermediates? I joined this Reddit to start and it’s helping but is there a place you recommend to get a crash course or a quick reference guide? Please help me navigate this uncharted territory so my kid will think he has a good mom!Edit: I am getting so much good info. I told my kiddo that I asked about this and that it was getting tons of attention then I tried out what I learned so far by asking about “peripherals” and even though it made him laugh I can tell he liked my effort! To answer some popular questions he wants to use this for gaming VR (eventually) and editing his videos. I will also clarify that I’m trying to learn this so I can understand him show complete interest in this since it’s important to him and help if there’s room for me. I realize that he may not need my help but I think moms always want to help. However this is his territory and I’m not interested in taking it over. All of these wonderful resources make me feel like I won’t just be a helpless bystander or a deer in the headlights trying to cheer him on. I know he can do this without me and do it well! I want to be ready to intelligently talk about it and maybe help a little if I’m needed."
"People with 9 or 10 series cards that 3070 is an incredible purchase no doubt about it.  The performance jump is amazing for you.I'd be giddy with excitement.HOWEVER.If you're sat on a 970 or a 1060 or a 1080 I'd wager your CPU RAM and Mobo are dated.The 3070 if Nvidia are to be believed (and I remain sceptical based on...all other releases of GPUs ever) will rival the 2080ti.PHOENOMENAL COSMIC POWAAAAAAAH! And yes idibity living space if you're sat on a 7+ year old CPU DDR3 RAM and a 1080p monitor at 60 or 120hz like MOST PEOPLE ARE THESE DAYS if Steam surveys are to be believed.If so and you're on old hardware the 3070 will be completely wasted on you.  If you're on old hardware I don't think you've seen what a 2080ti is capable of in person.  And the 3070 is basically on par with it (possibly).  The 2080ti is built for 4K 60+ FPS.  And is ENTIRELY wasted on a 1080p monitor.A 10 series card is more than capable of running 1080p on a 120hz monitor.  A 9 series struggles.Unless you're jumping to 1440p 100hz 120z or 144hz or a 4K setup with a CPU Mobo and RAM to match...the 3070 is a waste of power on you.You absolutely SHOULD upgrade your CPU and RAM and Mobo and monitor to match the power of the 3070.THINK AHEAD GUYS AND GALS.Don't grab a 3000 series card unless you're going to match the rest of your hardware with it including and especially the monitor.You're looking at the best part of $300-500 on a new 1440p 144hz monitor similar for a CPU ideally Ryzen [Edit - okay some are pissing at me about fanboyism here but you're picking Nvidia over AMD because Nvidia are better so how is that different to Ryzen over Intel when Ryzen are faster or just as fast for far less money?] another $50-100 on RAM another $100-200 on a mobo."
"I remember everyone jumping ship as soon as they could get 2080ti performance for $500 (or thats what we thought at the time) and i saw 2080ti’s on hardware swap and other marketplaces for $300 i was very tempted to grab one but i am still happy with my rx 5700 xt."

"My son wants a EVGA GEFORCE GTX 1050ti SC.. https://newegg.com/products/N82E16814487291?cm_re=gtx_1050_ti-_-14-487-291-_-ProductIts $216.  We have 4 kids and I can’t afford that for one gift for one kid.He plays COD Overwatch etc etc on it so he’s a gamer I just am not sure what I can get that’s comparable or somewhat close for less than this.  Currently he’s using a vid card that 4+ years old so anything at this point would probably be an upgrade.  Thanks so much guys for your help -----------------------EDIT:  All I can say is WOW.  I certainly didn't come here expecting this I was only looking for advice for alternatives.  Just... wow.   I figured it would be fitting to do a quick edit to let you all know what the plan is with the video card droxgh04 is so thoughtfully sending to my son (partially taken from one of my earlier replies on this thread).My son is going to see this thread and I couldn't be happier. Im going to give him the video card that droxgh04 is giving him the tag will say FROM "droxgh04" and not me which will be confusing to him but amazing to see. I'm also including a complete print out of this entire thread (sans neg comments and the dildo discussion above which was completely fascinating but not appropriate for his dad to include for him).  I'll take pictures when he opens the gift reads the thread and post it all here after Christmas day.Thanks to droxgh04 and all of you here my son is going to learn an incredible lesson far more valuable than getting just a video card from his dad on Christmas. Now he's getting a gift from a complete stranger who turned a simple question into an inspiring moment which has seemed to impact a couple thousand people.   So thanks to you droxgh04 Branden isn't just getting a video card from you for christmas but he's getting a lesson of giving and along with a box full of humanity.Thank you all so much.   I'll DEFINITELY be paying it forward and I hope all of you do the same as well.Merry Christmas!"

"So our IT teacher was showing us how to build a computer and everything went fine until he tried installing the cpu. He was installing the cpu and (idk if he didn't align the arrows on the cpu and motherboard or what but) he bent like half of the pins. But yeah. That's how our IT class went."
"I built my own PC recently upgraded from gaming on an old laptop. My performance gains compared to my laptop are through the roof.Yet for some reason I felt more excited spending time researching parts and putting the build together with my own two hands than being able to run almost everything so smoothly which was kind of the point of buying a PC. It feels like an addiction- I must build more PCs. Anyone else feel the same way?edit: thank you all for the shiny awards and merry belated christmas!"
"UserBenchmark just got banned on r/hardware and should also be banned here.Not everyone is aware of how biased their "benchmarks" are and how misleading their scoring is. This can influence the decisions of novice pc builders negatively and should be mentioned here. Among the shady shit they're pulling: something along the lines of the i3 being superior to the 3900x because multithreaded performance is irrelevant. Another new comparison where an i5-10600 gets a higher overall score than a 3600 despite being worse on every single test: https://mobile.twitter.com/VideoCardz/status/1250718257931333632Oh and their response to criticism of their methods was nothing more than insults to the reddit community and playing this off as a smear campaign: https://www.userbenchmark.com/page/aboutEven if this post doesn't get traction or if the mods disagree and it doesn't get banned please just refrain from using that website and never consider it a reliable source.Edit:First a response to some criticism in the comments: You are right even if their methodology is dishonest userbenchmark is still very useful when comparing your PC's performance with the same components to check for problems. Nevertheless they are tailoring the scoring methods to reduce multi-thread weights while giving an advantage to single-core performance. Multi-thread computing will be the standard in the near future and software and game developers are already starting to adapt to that. Game developers are still trailing behind but they will have to do it if they intend to use the full potential of next-gen consoles and they will. userbenchmark should emphasize more on Multi-thread performance and not do the opposite.As u/FrostByte62 put it: "Userbenchmark is a fantic tool to quickly identify your hardware and quickly test if it's performing as expected based on other users findings. It should not be used for determining which hardware is better to buy though.Tl;Dr: know when to use Userbenchmark. Only for apples to apples comparisons. Not apples to oranges. Or maybe a better metaphor is only fuji apples to fuji apples. Not fuji apples to granny smith apples."As shitty and unprofessional their actions and their response to criticism were a ban is probably not the right decision and would be too much hassle for the mods. I find the following suggestion by u/TheCrimsonDagger to be a better solution: whenever someone posts a link to userbenchmark (or another similarly biased website) automod would post a comment explaining that userbenchmark is known to have biased testing methodology and shouldn’t be used as a reliable source by itself.----here is a list of alternatives that were mentioned in the comments:Hardware Unboxed https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8iQa1hv7oV_Z8D35vVuSgAnandtech https://www.anandtech.com/benchPC-Kombo https://www.pc-kombo.com/us/benchmark Techspot https://www.techspot.comand my personal favorite pcpartpicker.com - it lets you build your own PC from a catalog of practically every piece of hardware on the market from CPUs and Fans to Monitors and keyboards. The prices are updated regulary from known sellers like amazon and newegg. There are user reviews for common parts. There are comptability checks for CPU sockets GPU radiator and case sizes PSU capacity and system wattage etc.It is not garanteed that these sources are 100% unbiased but they do have a good reputation for content quality.

"For many years I've been a sceptic of SSDs despite the evidence that they are miles better than a HDD. I didn't believe that upgrading to an SSD could offer much of a performance boost other than for file transfer speeds. Recently my laptop has been becoming increasingly sluggish; long boot times slow program opening and an often unresponsive Windows OS.In response to this I decided it was time to attempt the upgrade to an SSD. After cloning my drive with Macrium and popping the new drive in I was simply AMAZED by how fast the laptop booted up logged in and could open programs. From switch on to having Photoshop open it takes about 30 seconds when it used to take around 5 minutes.TL;DR - Get an SSD. It's worth it.LoveAn SSD Sceptic&#x200B;Edit 1: Okay so the response to this has been much bigger than I previously expected so I thought I'd clarify some things. First I own a mid-range 'budget' laptop and not a top-end PC because I am a student on a limited budget. Second 'sceptic' may have been the wrong word as it suggests I was \*denying\* the obvious fact that SSDs are *technically* faster. What I meant was I was unsure what effect an SSD would have with *my specific setup*. Third in the UK it's spelt sceptic not skeptic :P. Fourth for everyone saying "SSDs have been standard for at least 10+ years1!11!!!" No they haven't. Even in 2012 the price of a 500GB Crucial SSD (a budget drive manufacturer) was over £400. Four. Hundred. Pounds. For half a terabyte. I can guarantee that was not "standard". Fifth I know I'm late to the party. That is what this post is about. &#x200B;Thank you so much to everyone on this thread who has been so kind and welcoming. All the upvotes and awards have been amazing. It's refreshing to see that a good majority of the PC building community are so positive and that it's only a small number who decide to be gatekeeping elitists. At the end of the day everyone who is behind the technology curve has their reasons to be. Whether it be lack of budget knowledge time or space it usually isn't their fault. So when they do upgrade just celebrate the fact they have. Don't judge them for being many years late."
"I sometimes see builds intended for children less than 10 years old or around that age.     I did some builds for children and let me tell you your child is probably going to fool around with the computer children are clumsy they kick fall spill their drinks download all kinds of stuff because they're children it's completely normal.            Whenever I see builds containing Ryzen 5s and RTX cards I can't help but think how much of a headache it's going to be for the parent when their child repeatdly mistreat their thounsand dollar gift. This headache from the parents can also turn into resentment for the child trust me I've seen this parents buys a gift they're passionate about and get frustrated with the child because in the end the gift was more about the parent than the hapiness of the child.            So when a dad approached me with a build for his two children a boy and a girl age 9 and 12 I had to lay some basic rules:             -Keep a flashdrive with an image of windows somewhere     -Backup important/personnal files using an automated cloud system and a synced folder     -Put the computer ON the desk and a reasonable distance from the edge not under your child is going to kick when they get excited and the more distance to the ground the less likely a drink is going to be spilled on it.      -Keep the price to a minimum your child probably isn't going to play Civ 6 or Forza with you and chose instead to play roblox minecraft fortnite and among us rigorously. Also the less expensive the less frustrated if anything happens to the hardware the best child computers are made from hands me down parts or used parts.      -Cut corners on performance and invest in looks children LOOOOOOVE RGB they're crazy about it if I sell a PC it's for a teen or a child and it's because it has RGB. I can sell a buildk with a 6th gen i5 higher than a build with a Ryzen 5 2600 simply based on the amount of ARGB stuff I put in. Really invest heavily on looks pick a good case and max out those ARGB rainbow puke.            To that father I sold him two computer one with a black case and red LEDS for the son one with a white case and pink LEDS for the daughter. Both with hardware from a few generations ago and budget GPUs (1050 and gtx 750ti) and they're really happy on roblox and minecraft from what I heard.           TL;DR: you have to approach a build differently if it's aimed for a child focus on looks instead of performance and don't spend too much on something you know will break."
"I've had my PC for 3 weeks and thought I've been using 144hz this whole time but when calibrating my monitors today I noticed they were sitting at 60hz still. Here is how you check of course you need a monitor capable of 144hz and a DisplayPort Dual-link DVI or HDMI 2.0 connection. [Picture Guide](https://imgur.com/a/rPfPy)* Right-click your desktop and choose **Display settings** * Scroll down and select **Display adapter properties*** In the properties window click on **List All Modes*** Scroll down and choose your desired mode (e.g. 144hz) and apply* If you have more than one monitor you will need to select the other monitor in windows display and repeat stepsHopes this helps some others who weren't aware of the setting. I'm not sure if Nvidia has the option natively in the menu but I couldn't find it my AMD settings. **Edit:** A couple people pointed out Nvidia has the option in its settings and also apparently HDMI 2.0 supports 144hz. **Edit:** Woke up to my first gold this morning. This is the best Christmas ever! Thank you :)*To the Ebenezer Scrooges calling us noobs etc... for not knowing. I'm sure that like me many just assumed buying a 144hz monitor would well be in 144hz. There is no shame in learning. Merry Christmas everyone!*"
"Basically the title I decided to build a gaming pc during quarantine with my dad and after a month or so of research I built it and everything works properly. However my entire family now is under the impression that I know all about how computers work. This is not the truth AT ALL. I know where to find things in Windows settings and I know the basic function of the parts of my pc but I still have no clue what MHz are what motherboard specs mean among many other things. I had to call a professional to reinstall windows for me when I got a corrupted system update. I’m by no means a computer whiz. Anyone else experienced this?"
"Thought I'd put this somewhere because I thought it was funny. I came home and my mother was holding my tube of leftover NT-H1 thermal paste and asked me why I had a syringe in my room. Nothing really happened but I didn't even think of that as a potential mix-up. Cracked me up :joy:"
"I just finished my first PC build ever (also my first time owning a PC). Spent 45 heart-wrenching minutes trying to boot it up but it was a no go.

"It happens. I'm not mad at him. He waited for hours to tell me because he felt terrible and the look on his face when he finally said something pretty much squashed any anger I might have had about it. My main concern was how upset he was. I do wish he'd said something immediately so that I could have turned it off right away but he didn't know any better and I doubt that it would have made any difference anyway. He's probably apologized ten times today. He wants to help me fix it and offered to try and pay for it somehow even though at ten years old he obviously doesn't have the money for that. Whatever I end up doing I'll try and find a way to let him contribute so he feels better.Anyway. I'm not sure how to go about testing the components to see what's fried and what's not. I'm pretty sure the motherboard is dead (solid red LED no POST). The good news is that this is a five-year-old build so it's not like it's my brand-new baby. I did spend a decent amount over the years upgrading things but nothing was ever super high-end; I tend to shoot for right in the middle of the price range on components.I'm basically going to have to start over with a new build right? There's no hope of saving this is there? I have no idea what might also be fried besides the motherboard or how to test anything without a working motherboard.**Edit: As a longtime lurker here I have heard and observed so many great things about the community in this subreddit but holy crap. You all are damn near gonna make me cry. I posted this in a moment of frustration and thought maybe I'd get a few tips on what to do in this situation. I never expected such an outpouring of support and offers for help. A number of you have offered to send me components that we could use to rebuild and that blows me away. I never expected that at all and I'm just completely humbled by the generosity. I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart.**"

PCIExpress is forward and backward compatible meaning a PCIe1.0 graphics card from 15 years ago will still work in your PCIe4.0 PC today and your RTX 2060 (PCIe 3.0) is compatible with your old PCIe2.0 motherboard. Generational changes increase total bandwidth (16x PCIe1.0 provides 4GBps throughput 16x PCIe4.0 provides 32GBps throughput) however most modern GPUs aren’t bandwidth constrained and won’t see large improvements or losses moving between 16x PCIe3.0 and 16x PCIe4.0.\[[1](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-pci-express-scaling/6.html)\]\[[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAwIh1nSOQ8)\]. **If you have a single 16x PCIe3.0 or PCIe4.0 slot your board is slot compatible with any available modern GPU.**2. **Size compatibility -** To ensure your video card will fit in your case it is good practice to compare the card’s [**length width (usually # of slots) and height**](https://i.imgur.com/v85vEx6.png) with your case's compatibility notes. Maximum GPU **length** is often listed in your case manual or on your case's product page ([NZXT H510 for example](https://i.imgur.com/lUP4vx8.png)). Remember to take into account front mounted fans and radiators which often reduce **length** clearance by 25mm to over 80mm. GPU **height** clearance is not usually explicitly listed but can usually be compared to CPU tower height clearance. In especially slim cases some tall GPUs may interfere with the side panel window. GPU **width** (or number of slots) compatibility is easy to visually assess. mITX cases typically support a max of 2 slots mATX typically 4 slots ATX focused cases typically 7 slots or more. Be mindful that especially wide GPUs may interfere with your ability to install other add in cards like WiFi or storage controllers.3. **Power compatibility -** GPU TDP while actually referring to thermals often serves as a good estimation of maximum power draw in regular use cases at stock settings. GPUs may draw their TDP + 20% (or more!) under heavy load depending on overclock boosting characteristics partner model limitations or CPU limitations. Total system power is primarily your CPU+GPU power consumption. Situations where both the CPU and GPU are under max load are rare in gaming and most consumer workloads but may arise in simulation or heavy render workloads. See GamersNexus' system power draw comparison for popular CPU+GPU combinations between production heavy workloads [here](https://i.imgur.com/h4QBRky.png) and gaming [here](https://i.imgur.com/V6a8MST.png). It is always good practice to plan for maximum power draw workloads or power draw spikes. Follow your GPU manufacturer's recommendations take into account PCPartPicker's estimated power draw and always ask for recommendations here or in the Buildapc Discord. **NVIDIA RECOMMENDATIONS**: * **When necessary it is strongly recommended you use two SEPARATE 8-pin power connectors** instead of a [daisy-chain connector](https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6r9d.jpg).* **For power connector adapters we recommend you use the 12-pin dongle that already comes with the RTX 3080 GPU. However there will also be excellent modular power cables that connect directly to the system power supply available from other vendors including Corsair EVGA Seasonic and CableMod. Please contact them for pricing and additional product details.**&#x200B;**NVIDIA PROVIDED MEDIA**High res images and wallpapers of the Ampere release cards can be found [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/community/wallpapers/) and gifs [here](https://giphy.com/NVIDIA-GeForce)."
"WOW so I picked possibly the worst time in history to decide to build my first pc.

"Just tons of people saying they should have gotten the 3080 and complaining about the price to performance ratio. The 3080 is super hard to find and is already above the 1000$ market and i would imagine it goes up again before the super. I just don’t get why under so many build posts people are crapping on the 3090. Mine works amazing and at this point i paid only a couple hundred more bucks then a 3080 is priced for so much less hassle"
"For the past week and a half I've been hearing a grinding noise when I turn on my PC which only lasts for a second. I've been thinking it's my PSU fan and everything is brand new so I was kinda worried. I've held off on investigating it since I was a bit busy but last night when I was about to return it and get another PSU I finally did a thorough investigation.When I put my ear close to the PSU and turned on my PC the sound wasn't even coming from it. It was coming from somewhere else. I tried loosening the screws on my HDD but that wasn't it either.It was my new Xbox controller I got a week and a half ago which vibrates on start up and happens to sit right next to my PC case where the PSU is..."

"I've seen a lot of hype around 4K gaming monitors as the new Nvidia GPUs will supposedly have the power to drive that. My thoughts are: yes you'll be able to run 4K at acceptable refresh rates but you don't need to and you probably don't want to either.First of all some disclaimers:* **If you play on a TV 4K is fine**. 4K TVs dominate the market and finding a good non-4K one is way harder in 2020. But I'm specifically talking about PC monitors here.* 2K isn't a monitor resolution stop saying 2K to mean 2560x1440. If it existed it would mean "half 4K" (as in "half the horizontal definition") so 1920x1080  *<- pet peeve of mine but I lost this battle a long time ago** French speakers can find my ramblings [on this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/ebdgh8/guide_moniteurs_12_r%C3%A9solutiond%C3%A9finition_type_de/) with more details and monitor recommendations.*****## Resolution and pixel density Or "which resolution is ideal at which size". What you need to look for on a monitor is the ratio between size and resolution : **pixel density (or Pixel Per Inch/PPI)**. PPI tolerence varies between people but it's often between 90 (acceptable) to 140 (higher is indistinguishable/has diminishing returns). Feel free to use the website https://www.sven.de/dpi/ to calculate your current PPI and define your own range.With this range in mind we can make this table of common sizes and resolutions:|       	| 24" 	| 27" 	| 32" 	| 34" 	||-------	|-----	|-----	|-----	|-----	|| (FHD) 1080p 	| **92**  	| 82  	| 69  	| 64  	|| (QHD) 1440p 	| **122** 	| **109** 	| **92**  	| 86  	|| (UHD) 2160p 	| 184 	| 163 	| **137** 	| **130** 	|As you can see 1080p isn't great for higher sizes than 24" (although some people are ok with it at 27") and 4K is too well defined to make a difference.In my experience as someone who has been using 1440p@60Hz monitors for a while 32" is where it starts to be annoying and I'd consider 4K.*****## Screen "real estate"A weird term to define how much space you have on your monitor to display windows text web pages... The higher the resolution the more real estate you have but the smaller objects will become. Here's the comparison (from my own 4K laptop) to how much stuff you can display on 3 different resolutions : [FHD](https://imgur.com/3lxAmGi) [QHD](https://imgur.com/cBNLWFJ) [4K UHD](https://imgur.com/ey9etWR). Display those in full screen on your monitor and define at which point it becomes too small to read without effort. For most people **4K at 27" is too dense** and elements will be too small.*****## Yes but I can scale right?Yes scaling (using HiDPI/Retina) is a possibility. But **fractional scaling** is a bad idea. If you're able to use integer scaling (increments of 100%) you'll end up with properly constructed pixels for example at 200% [one scaled pixel is rendered with 4 HiDPI pixels](https://miro.medium.com/max/2048/1*-7KPTGz-RnHS_EWl27-DTg.png). But at 125/150/175% it'll use **aliasing** to render those pixels. That's something you want to avoid if you care for details.And if you use 200% scaling you end up with a 1080p real estate which isn't ideal either: you're now sacrificing desktop space.In gaming that's a non-issue because games will scale themselves to give you the same field of view and UI size whatever the resolution. But you don't spend 100% of your time gaming right?*****## 5K actually makes more sense but it's not available yetOr barely. There's oddities like the LG 27MD5K or Apple's own iMac Retina but no real mainstream 5K 27" monitor right now. But why is it better than 4K outside of the obvious increase in pixel density? **200% "natural" scaling** that would give 1440p real estate with great HiDPI sharpness. Ideal at 27". But not available yet and probably very expensive at launch.5K would also be the dream for 4K video editors: they'd be able to put a native 4K footage next to the tools they need without sacrificing anything.*****## GPU usage depending on resolutionWith 4K your GPU needs to push more pixels per second. That's not as much of an issue if RTX cards delivers (and possible AMD response with Big Navi) but that's horsepower more suited to higher refresh rates for most people. Let's take a look at the increase of pixel density (and subsequent processing power costs):FHD:* 1080p@60Hz = 124 416 000 pixels/s* 1080p@144Hz = 298 598 400 pixels/s* 1080p@240Hz = 497 664 000 pixels/sQHD: (1.7x more pixels)* 1440p@60Hz = 221 184 000 pixels/s* 1440p@144Hz = **530 841 600 pixels/s*** 1440p@240Hz = 884 736 000 pixels/s4K: (2.25x more pixels)* 4K@60Hz = **497 664 000 pixels/s*** 4K@144Hz = 1 194 393 600 pixels/s* 4K@240Hz = 1 990 656 000 pixels/s*[EDIT] As several pointed out this do not scale with GPU performance obviously just a raw indicator. Look for accurate benchmarks of your favorite games at those resolutions.*So we see running 4K games at 60Hz is almost as costly than 1440p at 144Hz and that 4K at 144Hz is twice as costly. Considering some poorly optimized games still give the RTX 2080Ti a run for its money 4K gaming doesn't seem realistic for everyone.I know some people are fine with 60Hz and prefer a resolution increase I myself chose to jump on the 1440p 60Hz bandwagon when 1080p 144Hz panels started to release but for most gamers a refresh rate increase will be way more important.*****In the end that's your money get a 4K monitor if you want. But /r/buildapc is a community aimed towards sound purchase decisions and I don't consider that to be one. I wish manufacturers would either go full 5K or spend their efforts on perfecting 1440p monitors (and reducing [backlight bleeding issues](https://imgur.com/a/n8Merv3) come on!) instead of pushing for 4K but marketing sells right?**TL;DR from popular request:** at 27" 4K for gaming does not provide a significant upgrade from 1440p and for productivity ideally we'd need 5K to avoid fractional scaling. But don't take my word for it try it out yourself if you can.[EDIT] Feel free to disagree and thanks to everyone for the awards.*****[sven.de - PPI calculator](https://www.sven.de/dpi/)[Elementary OS blog - What is HiDPI](https://medium.com/elementaryos/what-is-hidpi-and-why-does-it-matter-b024eabea20d)[Elementary OS blog - HiDPI is more important than 4K](https://medium.com/elementaryos/hidpi-is-more-important-than-4k-b1b9bb110b43)[Viewsonic - Resolutions and aspect ratios explained](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/tech/monitor-resolution-aspect-ratio/)[Eizo - Understanding pixel density in the age of 4K](https://www.eizo.com/library/basics/pixel_density_4k/)[Rtings - Refresh rate of monitors](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/tests/motion/refresh-rate)"
"I run across so many posts where this is the case.  If you have two different brands of 1x8gb RAM for a total of 16gb this can cause problems.  As well as different timings speed etc.  If you bought two of the same RAM sticks but didn't buy them in a package together this can in some situations cause problems.  Some RAM of the same types will have different ICs later in productions.Often an OP will state later on in the troubleshooting process that they bought one stick of RAM at a later date to "upgrade".   We could've helped you figure out that your RAM was not playing nice together much sooner if this was listed.Edit: RIP inbox and thank you for the awards!  Glad this thread took off.

"This story is so unbelievable I’m still processing it but long story short my roommate came from the bars last night and brought his girl with him. She came into my room at 5am thinking it was the bathroom sat on my computer and started peeing. I have opening vents at the top so the urine dropped down into my computer and the MOBO and GPU. (It’s the Meshify C case if you were wondering). I opened it up immediately and dried it down with a towel the GPU the MOBO and everything else I found the liquid on. Right now it’s drying next to the window pointed at the sun. How long should I wait to test it? Is there anything else I can do to hopefully preserve it? I’m hesitant to unplug cables and take out the parts because it’s been 4 months since I built it and all my PC building skills are nonexistent completely. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do thank you.edit: i appreciate all the advice and awards however please don’t send me any more awards. i’m not sure if it costs money or what but just please keep it to yourself. i just browse reddit i barely make posts. I will be trying the tips in here and i’ll keep you guys updated. thank you so much for the advice.edit: a lot of you are asking for pictures. here they are this is after i’ve already wiped everything. cable management took me so long. https://imgur.com/gallery/eOZ7D5q i obviously unplugged a couple components.edit: update https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/dyrr0m/update_my_pc_was_pissed_on_last_night_please_help/"
"I can't post this in r/hardwareswap so i figured this would be the next best spot.  About a month ago i sold some pc parts to u/killerabbit and everything went perfect.  Last week i sold my GTX 1060 6GB to another redditor however i got mixed up and put the wrong shipping label and mailed it to u/killerabbit.  Called the post office and they weren't able to stop the shipment re-route it or even send it back to me.  On a whim i contacted kilerabbit and explained the issue and he/she was more than willing to help when they didn't need to.  He/she quickly printed out a new shipping lable provided by me and mailed it out the next morning.  IN a world full of people trying to get over on each other i just wanted to publicly thank this person for helping me out because i could've been out a graphic card and the cash that was paid to me for it as i'd have to refund the purchase since this was totally my fault."
"I shit you not their response was “well you know the BIOS is only a battery.” Anyways I ended up using my MOBO’s “flashback” feature and got the BIOS updated myself."
"I have seen a couple of threads lately with people asking if they can leave the computer turned on when they sleep.The answer is always the same: YES. But I've never seen anyone saying something else that I feel is more important.&#x200B;Nevermind your bills  ≈ 500Wxhr/hour x 10 hours is [on average](https://blueskymodel.org/kilowatt-hour) **2.6kg (or 5.7 pounds) of carbon dioxide going into the air nightly**. If 100 million people worldwide do this that's a quarter of a billion kg of CO2 every night. I am not saying PCs are killing us because that's just a "drop" of water considering the other emissions we have but this is a plain waste of energy that our environment can't really afford. **Hibernate your computers** and powering them on will take half a minute or less.. don't be lazy and take this approach with you whatever you do.&#x200B;EDIT: While idling the PC consumes less than 500W it really depends on the build and I'm not sure what the average nation-wise would be but that's just a 2-5 factor.. the point stands (we still have to multiply our number for 365 if we want the waste by year...)."

"I want to build one eventually when I have the money but I’m afraid I’ll destroy something even with a tutorial haha. I have the basic knowledge such as “this part is a CPU this is a GPU their function is this etc.” but even then I’m afraid I’ll fry something. Forums like this make it look so easy though! Where did you learn to build them so flawlessly?"

"So I noticed a tiny black ant crawling around on screen yesterday. Tried to brush it off and realized this little bastard was INSIDE my monitor.  I was hoping it'd find its way out of fall down to bottom of screen.Came home from work and this is what I see: https://imgur.com/a/1rBgJThis evil insect decided to die in middle of my monitor.  It's a 1440p IPS display from Asus and it wasn't cheap.  Now I have this ant staring at me I assume forever.  Should I attempt to take it apart?  It doesn't seem like an easy task as it's probably more or less glued together.Shit.EDIT: Holy hell this blew up! This is the side of Reddit I love. Thanks all for the advice. My monitor ant and I will figure this out one way or another."
"I’ll most likely get downvoted for this but it’s pretty exhausting to see the community shitting on each other like it is right now. I’ve seen so many posts and YouTube videos essentially saying “hahaha you idiots should have waited!” “I bet you feel so dumb right now!” And while yes I’m sure most of us do I’d like to remind everyone of the circumstances that were transpiring. Most of us were stuck at home going on 3-5 months of doing absolutely nothing. Economy spinning out relations with Chinese supply chains exploding and a mental state of “just hold it together man” at best. In the same way a gardener turns to their garden or a woodworker turns to their bench I chose to put my energy into a new PC. Yes I knew a new gen of cards was coming out. No I didn’t think the prices were going to be this competitive. But regardless let’s stop shitting on people who had no jobs no stability and no clue what the future would look like. Gamers that chose to invest their time on something that would take away the existential dread for a short time. So if your kicking yourself cause you bought a 2000 series think back to where you were during that time. Was it the project you needed? Enjoy the hell out of that thing. Let’s be the community that applauds each other for building a PC and can we please remember why we’re all here? To talk shit about console gamers!"
"My dad has always loved the Flight Simulator series and got excited when the new one was coming out. He began to buy parts but quickly realized how expensive the project would be. He returned his mobo case ram and offered his Ryzen 5 and 1660 card to me. I accepted them and told him how much I appreciate it. One week later I showed up to his house with all the parts I ordered to begin building. We spent the day together (longest we’ve hung out in months due to covid) building the pc and I walked him through creating a steam account. As he was preparing to order FS the gift pop-up showed up telling him I had just gifted the game to him and I’ll see him in the sky. I’m so happy I’ll get to spend time with him doing some we both love."
"I'm working with a few friends to do a build for a financially unfortunate friend as a surprise. We have all the parts we need but an important factor is that this friend is also an asshole so since this PC will be free for him and he doesn't know enough about PCs to do a case swap himself we'd like to get him an extremely ugly case to put it in. He can't really do anything about it so we want the sort of thing he'll have to explain to his wife and everyone else who enters his house and sees it. The only real requirement is that it fit an ATX board and a dual fan AIO. The uglier the better. Horrid colors general ugly design odd shape hit me with your worst. We considered a sleeper build but decided against it due to space and airflow concerns. Would have loved to have gone with [this absolute abomination ](https://www.newegg.com/pink-iforgame-omg/p/2AM-02BF-00004) but it's unfortunately too small. That's the caliber of hideous we're aiming for though. Edit: Alrighty! I expected a couple dozen comments not a thousand! The idea I've settled on is an annoyingly [pink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DL9S57M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FYC1NCB8BYH5ZKC94X33?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) case with an extreme amount of hideous stickers! We've got apple stickers supreme stickers a decently sized live laugh love sticker all kinds of annoying bullshit! I even plan on putting his most hated hockey team's logo on there. Loved all the suggestions especially some of the wilder early 2000s cases. The main idea was to keep it simple and practical we don't want to do something that'll require heavy modding or have poor airflow. This one should do since it's fairly modern and it should have decent airflow while still having plenty of surface area we can freely cover with annoying stickers. We may also take some inspiration from the LTT twomad case and just... just put some random stuff on it too. I love/hate that idea and I love that someone brought that video to my attention. Sadly the unicorn horn (one of my favorite suggestions) likely won't fit on top but I was able to find some floppy bunny ears to throw on the sides which tbh I think will be much better/worse.  A last minute suggestion of googly eyes was also added. I'll make another post when the build is done and hopefully have a reaction video as well. Can't wait to show him this thread too once it's finally delivered."
"Firstly I wanted to say thank you all so so much for your help! I'll admit I was super nervous and overwhelmed the first time I posted but with your kind comments and my own research (plus the gem which is PCPartpicker) I feel happy I've gotten him everything he needs! Like I said in my original post he's never built a PC before and has always wanted to so this is all new. Plus he has the day off work tomorrow so he'll actually get the whole day to work on it.It's the eve of his birthday and I've banished him from our living room as he knows I'm setting up a surprise (but he doesn't know what). When lockdown started he didn't have a desk to do WFH so I painted his old one and reassembled it whilst he was away for a few days (he thought it was a sweet gesture and has no idea I did it because he needs space for [all of this!)](https://imgur.com/gallery/kBsV0ob)Ok ok I've rambled on enough!

I really hope he likes it!I'M SO FREAKING NERVOUS YOU GUYS!!!!Ok! Once again thank you all! I'm so grateful that I found such a wonderful kind and welcoming community to help me with this. You all rock!\-**Edit**: I updated his reaction in the comments but thought I'd discuss it in the main post and answer a few FAQs. Firstly thank you all for such a wonderful response! It's made my whole day :)Q: Where’s the mouse?He already has one!Q: What was his reaction?Like a kid on Christmas it was adorable. He’s been very happy all day. I asked him what to say in his own words and he replied: “I think this is the nicest present anyone has ever gotten me and I love my girlfriend very much.” (Oh gosh that was so weird to type I swear he said it I’m not making it up and now I’m going to hide under my desk for 1000 years).Q: The deal with the Power supply...I kept getting a lot of conflicting messages. I don’t know if power supplies work different in different countries because it seemed like my IRL friends from the UK were telling me the power supply is fine/works for them and people from the US are saying it would need more power? Either way if he needs an upgrade I guess that’s a Christmas present! Only this time he can do the research and tell me what to get him himself. I'll chalk it up to it being a rookie mistake.A couple of thoughts from someone who’s never seen a PC being built before…OH GOD THE PARTS ARE EVERYWHERE. MY LIVING ROOM IS FILLED WITH SO MUCH STUFF! I knew it was bound to happen and it’s not forever but SHEESH! Haha!u/allgoodnamesaregone4 (bf’s reddit username) will comment with some more updates. I was at work most of the day so I missed the first part of the process. The kids can’t teach themselves how to order historical events on a timeline after all! The only thing that went wrong is that the graphics card covers the only pci slot so he can’t use the wifi card. I had to buy him a wifi USB adapter (he researched the one he wants and I got it for him). It will arrive on Sunday. Our place is a little on the small side and the ethernet port is on the other side of the room so things are a little trickier regarding cables but hopefully we can work something out between us!That’s it for now we’ll update with a new post once the build is complete which should hopefully be in a couple of days!Thanks everyone!"

" Every post I see says "wait for the 3060 or 3050". However THESE CARDS HAVE NOT BEEN OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED! I literally see people who want to build their PC this week and get told to wait an indefinite amount of time for something that officially we don't know is real. Finally considering how fast 3080 and 3090 sold out 3060 and 3050 (cheaper cards) will sell out quicker. So yeah we don't even know when these cards are releasing or if they even exist so start recommending things we know exist."
"Hey everyone friendly reminder to update your Display Settings in Windows when you are upgrading your monitor to 144hz 165hz etc...I have talked to three different friends now who have recently upgraded to a 144 or 165hz monitor and told me they didn't really notice a difference in performance from their old 60hz monitor. After some troubleshooting I noticed that in each case these friends had their monitors Screen refresh rate still set to 60hz in Windows.If right click your desktop and click on "Display Settings" the Display Settings window will open. Scroll down and see a hyperlink called "Advanced display settings". This menu will have a dropdown to select your monitor(s). Click on "Display adapter properties for Display 1(or 2)" and then click the "Monitor" tab and you can update the Screen refresh rate to your new monitors refresh rate. Now you will see the true improvement of your upgraded monitor!Also don't forget to update your Max FPS in your games to the new refresh rate so that you can experience all of the frames.Happy gaming!"

"A build that’s been 3 years in the making – ever since AMD announced the Ryzen line I knew that I had to put together a true Zen-themed build one day. Finally finished it extremely proud :)Feedback and comments are most welcomed! Please see pcpartpicker link for more detailed photos of the build coming together :) [https://pcpartpicker.com/b/Bdb8TW](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/Bdb8TW)  [https://imgur.com/gallery/lAvETb9](https://imgur.com/gallery/lAvETb9)"
"**Note:** Not sure if this is true for any other Windows besides Windows 10 and not sure if this has been fixed already or not (as I haven't enabled it since then).&nbsp;Quite a few months ago I found it weird that my laptop was using around 40-50% of my RAM while idle (no application open at all) out of my 8 GB.After searching for a bit I saw a possible fix that made no sense for me as "why would this work" but indeed it did work. Both to me and to a friend who also was asking why he was using so much ram. Two others did it and I believe they still saw some "improvement" even if not that great.The fix was very simple for me: to disable Windows tips and tricks.&nbsp;**To do so just follow these simple instructions:**&nbsp;* Press the Window key (usually between CTRL and ALT) or click the start icon.* Search for "Notifications" and press "Notifications & actions settings".* Disable "Get tips tricks and suggestions as you use Windows" by clicking on it.* Restart your computer.&nbsp;This worked for us at least and it went from around 40ish% to 20ish% of RAM usage to which I believe is where it should be at.I apologize if this can't be posted here and I apologize if this doesn't work anymore but hopefully (I think?) it does and it helps someone out.**Cheers.**&nbsp;**EDIT**: Woke up and saw I had been gifted gold (my first gold yey!) and I believe some coins/platinum/premium (I'll still have to check what exactly are those about not really sure what they are) so thank you a lot gifter! (Don't know if he allows me to say his name so I'll not post it at least for now).&nbsp;Some are saying not to disable this as unused ram is wasted ram. While this is true to me at least tips and tricks are also useless so there is no need for me to enable them.&nbsp;**Other (hopefully) fixes that might be helpful:**&nbsp;* If your disk usage is a lot of times at 100% on idle and you find yourself with office installed stopping the "ClickToRun" (I believe that is the name don't yet have office installed to confirm) service while not needing to use office might make the 100% usage to stop.* Not sure if it was CPU RAM or Disk usage regarding Windows Defender but sometimes it will try to scan it's own folder and will be stuck on a loop while doing so so you might want (not sure if recommended) to add Windows Defender folder as a folder to not search virus from on Windows Defender Settings (don't remember exactly how you do it but I believe that's what made my friend reduce the usage he had).&nbsp;Anyways regardless of wanting unused RAM or not hope I helped someone.&nbsp;**Edit2** Thank you for the platinum kind stranger."
"**UPDATE Feb 1 2021**-https://blog.nzxt.com/a-message-from-our-ceo-johnny-regarding-the-h1-safety-issue/NZXT has issued the above statement in response to Gamers Nexus' video and will be supplying a replacement PCIe riser to owners who have previously requested nylon screw kits. **Owners of the H1 case should contact NZXT for their replacement parts if they have not already done so.**-Original post:See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjUscSRLwksGamers Nexus investigated the PCIe riser fire issue and has concluded that the design of the riser has serious issues and poses a major fire hazard. The nylon screw fix issued by NZXT does not address the inherent design problem with the riser and so the riser is not safe to have installed in your system."
"He spends most of the video saying you should enable XMP this is completely correct. You definitely should. However this guy enables XMP his PC crashes and instead of wondering what's causing the crash he just dials the RAM speed back a bit and goes "this is fine" just because you dial the speed back a bit and windows boots does not mean it's stable. This guy's clueless. I noticed his bios version said "version 0403" this is the very first bios version for his motherboard meaning he is missing out on a ton of stability and performance improvements. No wonder his PC crashes. And as for the windows settings part of the video he doesn't even mention some of the more impactful changes you can do."
"I've been a long time PC gamer and have several friends who over the years expressed significant interest in building their own PC and gaming. Awesome - I thought. More people to game with always makes for a better time. When COVID hit obviously people spent more time at home needing better rigs to work off etc etc. So I spent a bit of time with each of them trying to pick out parts based on their needs and budget. Most of them opted to wait for 3xxx series cards before starting their builds. Which in hindsight was probably a bad idea.A lot of them were so excited they had some parts ready. Watched so many videos and tutorials. Even bought games. I was pumped for them too. But when it became clear that stock issues wouldn't resolve in the short-term... A lot lost interest. These are just normal guys - not the type who would set up discord alerts do all the extra tasks required to secure a card. Some opted to just get consoles others bought laptops because they needed something for work. Slowly each one just lost interest and honestly I don't blame them. I don't really know where I wanted to go with this... I guess I just wanted to rant. We're all getting to the age where we have our own things going on (jobs girlfriends moving out etc.) And... I was just hopeful that our gaming PCs would be a way for us to still come together as friends and share time with one another. It just sucks knowing that my friends who honestly were poised to pick up the hobby that I love long-term are just completely soured and turned off from the whole experience. I'm just sad really. I was so happy to share my world with them and now they think the industry simply doesn't want them as customers.Just thought I'd share my frustration with people who get it. Thanks for reading."
"I mean not only do they provide a free but insanely useful service but I looked in my closet today and found their shirt that I won from the giveaway along with a hand signed thank you note. Then I thought about it and realized they had to do the same thing with 3999 other winners. I couldn't even imagine how long it must have taken to have each employee sign 4000 cards as well as organizing shipping and delivering 4000 t-shirts.&#x200B;I know that appreciation posts are common in this subreddit but seriously hands down to the guys at pcpartpicker for doing god's work among this community."
"I framed all the processors I've owned over the years.   Each one is a phase from my life putting this together was surprisingly nostalgic.  It's been fun how each one brings back so many memories.  The shadowboxes are 3d printed cricut vinyl for the labels I even cut the glass myself too.

"No one will probably see this but whatever. Need to say something because it genuinely makes me feel bad. I frequent this sub and it's the first place I come to when I have a specific question about my PC or build. Unfortunately I've posted many times with questions I couldn't find the answer to or would take too long for me to confirm on my own and almost always received no responses. It seems to me from my time here that posts with funny content or posts that show someone's dumb "mistake" make it to the front page easily and are met with tons of conversation and discussion. But when I check out the "new" section it's filled with legitimate questions that I feel would be very easy for knowledgeable people to answer yet they're all empty and downvoted. I'm not angry that I have been trying all day to get some feedback on my PC upgrades but only a couple of people have given me a minute of their time. But I do feel kind of sad especially for the younger folks on here trying to get some help with their first or second builds or have a burning question. I'm also not saying people aren't doing enough on this subreddit I just feel this subreddit was meant to be a place where beginners could get help from more experience people and it certainly does not that feel that way. Maybe I'm in the minority or maybe I'm the only one feeling this way but I really like this subreddit and it's unfortunate I have to go to subreddits like pcmr to ask questions about my build. Anyway please downvote if I'm spouting nonsense which I very well may be. Thanks for reading.Edit: I appreciate people helping me out now and I'm sorry if I sounded a bit angry in my post it's been a long day. I still do stand by it though and would love your opinions if you have any!I understand it's impossible to help everyone and there's far more questions than people able to answer them. This is my personal experience as I have been browsing this subreddit for more than a year and feel this way currently. But I've read your responses and I appreciate you letting me see the other side of this. As someone reminded me the daily questions thread is another place to post as well. Last Edit: I'm going to bed now I really can't believe the response to this post and I'm very glad it stirred some genuine discussion about the topic. I think it's best to not look at it from a sides point of view and we should all just try to be patient and help each other out as much as possible. Thanks to a lot of you today I learned a lot and will pay that forward. E3: okay I just woke up and this is absolutely insane. So first off a lot of people are calling me elitist or cunt and I appreciate your contribution to the discussion. Here is the thing. I've found from experience it has been easier to get support or advice when posting about a build on OTHER subs  than this one. Whether thats pcmr or a smaller sub it justs frustrated me that a subreddit dedicated to helping with builds had a severe lack of exactly that. I'm not blaming anyone and its okay if you think I'm being elitist but thats how I viewed this sub. And obviously my views have shifted thanks to all the discussion going on here so again thanks for participating."

"Few days ago I spotted [this funny Amazon review](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/rh3rw2/54_people_found_this_helpfull/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and after making fun of it I noticed that a lot a people really don't know what's wrong with this picture. This btw was a 500$ Monitor getting resold by Amazon for half the price if you buy one of the returned. If someone still doesn't know  100-240V 50-60Hz means the monitor can handle Input voltage that is 50-60Hz from 100V to 240V that has nothing to do with the frequency the monitor can display. Btw every electronic device you own will have this data.Edit: because some people said this Monitor is not 500$ i don't remember the exact one it's a bunch of Dell monitors at Amazon with different specs but same reviews.Edit2: because I'm getting called out for "lying" I looked this up again. The monitor in question was LG 27GL850-B which is 420€ at Amazon at this moment. The reduced price was 208€. So yeah it's not 500$ but 475$ and not 50% but 495%. You got me..."

"This happens every generation for new CPU/GPU. Someone wants to buy a new GPU whether it's AMD or Nvidia and they get told to wait. If the new generation of GPUs get released in let's say October that's still at least 4 months of waiting. We all know supply will be limited at first and scalpers will make it slightly difficult to get a card. I've seen Redditors tell someone wanting a 2060 to wait for the 3060. The "lower-end" Nvidia GPUs won't be out till 2021.Prices won't drop when the new cards get announced. People keep saying "wait for xxxx prices will drop". Nvidia will most likely discontinue the older generation than drop the price. Retailers won't drop prices either."

"Building a PC is actually more entertaining than you think. However if you don't like to do research about a part's specs then you might not find this helpful. This is how you will truly value your PC this way you will look at your PC and know its worth instead of looking at a box shape with some lights.This guide is useful when building from scratch since it will go through all parts one by one in the best possible order to greatly reduce the amount of times you have to go back and change parts. (You might not even have to go back and change parts at all).If you need to upgrade and/or still looking for parts skip to the respective section for the part you will profit aswell from reading this guide.*"The most important part is to HAVE FUN!" -Waffler11*&#x200B;Before we start there are a some things that you have to be clear about:1. **This guide will not Build the PC for you. This is a guide for you to know what to look for and which parts are most suitable for your build.**2. **Read every single thing you don't know about each part's specs obviously you don't have to go crazy with all things. I will be mentioning things that YOU NEED to look for but the more curious you are the better.**3. **This will help you easily determine most incompatibilities and help you build everything part by part so you don't have to go back to a specific part and change it over and over.**&#x200B;**Organization**1. Google for your preferred web page for building PCs. I don't want to seem like promoting a Webpage in particular but PcPartPicker worked great for me and they give you warnings regarding incompatibility. (Other websites might do the same).2. Ask yourself: "For what am I building this PC". To run a game in particular? perhaps to have the best of the best? who knows? Only you. It is based on this that you will build your PC and estimate a budget (notice how I said estimate a budget because it will vary as you learn more about PC parts).3. Once you know what you want your PC for you will have to preplan. This is having an idea of what GPU you need to run certain games and is actually the most notorious part of a PC so think of one but might not be the definitive GPU (you might even want to change GPU brands).4. What if you want to choose the **Monitor** first? No problem at all you can also choose your desired GPU based on the **Resolution** and **Refresh Rates** you wish to play. In this case if you want to know which monitor will be the best for you scroll down to the "**Monitor**" part of the Guide. (Keep in mind that prioritizing the Monitor means you have to try to keep the GPU that can run at the desired Resolution and Refresh Rates while also keeping in mind any bottleneck from both GPU and CPU)Notice: Some RGB counterparts will be more expensive so if you want a lot of RGB on your PC you know what to expect on that budget. More on this as the guide goes on.&#x200B;**First Part: CPU**Forget about that beautiful case you saw somewhere or those cool shaped RAMs or the flashy Motherboard CHOOSE A CPU FIRST.**How To Choose A CPU For Your Needs**1. First of all know your options Intel and AMD are both very good check out for those 2.2. Please take your time to read about the CPU specs. Things to look for are **Cores** **Threads** **Base Clock** **Boost Clock** and their general performance in your trusted benchmark webpage. All these specs differ from Generation and Model.3. You don't have to worry between AMD Intel and Nvidia CPUs and GPUs not working properly together or being incompatible they will work smoothly in any combination.4. Consider for the future about **Single** **Dual** and **Quad Channel.** This is for the RAM I suggest you read about these now and choose a CPU which supports these Channels. Having more than **Single Channel** will increase the RAMs brandwidth leading to increased **Memory Read** **Write** **Copy** and **Brandwidth.**5. Stock coolers usually comes with a stick thermal paste already applied as well as some coolers from other brands that you but some may not have the paste applied so its good that you read if they will have it already applied or not.6. Thermal Paste: Keep in mind that eventually you will need to reapply paste if you move the cooler if you notice an unusual increase in your temps or after a few years. In which case you can get a good Thermal Paste they are are relatively cheap make a big impact on your CPU temperatures and are easy to apply. So there is no harm getting a Thermal Paste just make sure you get a quality thermal paste. And yes some reduce temperatures better than others but also the way you apply it and the amount you apply helps reducing temperatures look for the best way and quantity.Notice: You don't necessarily have to prioritize the GPU over the CPU this is just in case you plan on only playing less demanding popular games like CS:GO LoL Valorant etc. they don't require the best of GPUs out there so you can go for a better CPU.&#x200B;**Second Part: Case**Cases comes in many sizes the 3 most popular ones are: **Full Tower Mid Tower and Mini-ITX.** Check out each of these case's sizes and spacing. Some cases of the same size category will vary in sizes and some times not fit the motherboard of the specific size category. For Ex: An ATX case might be smaller than most ATX cases and an ATX motherboard might not fit properly so also checking the cases's dimensions where the motherboard will be placed it is important to be aware of these scenarios.1. Keep in mind the size of your GPU (since it takes a lot of space) to make sure it fits on your case. New Gen GPUs are being manufactured in a bigger size.2. It's time to choose the manufacturer they will mostly vary in Aesthetics however keep in mind you should probably want to make sure the case has good "Airflow" the name itself tells you what it is but look it up if you are not sure. Best way to make sure the case has good airflow is to check reviews... multiple reviews and good ones where they will specify what room temp they had during the test so you get an idea.3. Make sure you get a modern case you won't regret it but you might want a modern case so you can use all of the motherboard's ports and not waste a single penny also when upgrading the motherboard since you are more likely to change the motherboard before the case (this is another reason why the case is the second part).4. Check what's in the box for the case you want to choose it might not come in with enough fans than you expected or maybe it won't come with some of the things you see in some pictures.&#x200B;**Third Part:** **GPU**You probably did not expected this but there is nothing complicated about GPUs.1. Look for features about each GPU brand and model there are brands and model with their own features that is why I can't list them to you depends on what brand you choose.2. You have already chose a Brand because you knew which one would run the game you want to play or maybe you changed brands and models. Either way now it's time for you to look about the specifications: **Base Clock Boost Clock** & **Memory Size.** (I want you to look at this because they vary depending on Brand Model and Series and they give you an idea on which you would rather choose)3. Now you most likely already decided your Brand Model and Series for the GPU check out the **Display Connectors** and keep that in mind we will need this for the monitor.Notice: The more **Memory Capacity** the GPU has does not mean better performance.&#x200B;**Fourth Part: Motherboard**Ah yes the motherboard remember the CPU you chose? and the case you chose? here is where you will be limited to your motherboard choosing. (choosing the right motherboard might take awhile specially with all the features one motherboard can have and all the different variations). Also you might come across **SLI (for Nvidia)** and/or **CrossFire (for Radeon)**. Before you get hyped games need to be SLI/CrossFire compatible and not to mention that sometimes it will not work with different **GPUs Architecture.** So instead of spending money for this feature in a motherboard and for 1 extra GPU your best choice is for a single high-end GPU. (Also with the amount of power and performance on the new gen GPUs SLI and CrossFire are less worth.\*IMPORTANT: Please read motherboard specs and features literally anything you don't know look up what it is this is critical for building a PC. Looking for everything will also let you easily identify incompatibilities. Some motherboards does not include Sound Card and/or Wi-Fi cards.1. First and I mean it first you must make sure that your motherboard fits the case motherboards commonly come in mini ITX and ATX look those up in google and make sure which size is the one for your case (obviously you will realize a mini ITX motherboard can actually be used on a mid tower or bigger).2. Now you will choose a motherboard with the right Socket depending on the CPU you chose.3. Now make sure that the motherboard's BIOS is up to date with the CPU you chose or you will get firetrucked up yours. Pro Tip: google "Best motherboards for \[CPU of your choosing\]".4. Another important thing to consider for a motherboard if it supports **Dual Channel** & **Quad Channel**.5. Great with all those 4 filters you can freely look for a nice looking Motherboard for your PC build and read the specs yes please read them you won't regret it. Specially since I almost bought a motherboard dedicated for custom water cooling I was about to pay extra for nothing.6. Some other important things to look for in a motherboard are the amount of **VRM** and their quality. The amount of **Memory Type** and also how much **Memory Speed** is supported the **storage drives slots** available. Another lesser thing to look for in a motherboard is that each motherboard brand offers their unique features check them out if you feel like and see which one you like the most.Notice: Wi-Fi Cards are not mandatory they are more of an option.&#x200B;**Fifth Part: RAM**There is more to look for a RAM than you might think don't just look for a RAM based on the amount of GBs it has. RAM comes in different **Memory Type** and have different **Memory Speed** and **CAS Latency** check out what role both of these terms play in a PC to choose your preferred one.1. You can buy individually RAM usually comes in pair properly named as "**RAM Kit**" which some are 8GB (2x4) or 16GB (2x8) or 32GB (4x8) or 32GB (2x16) etc. If you still haven't figured it out let me explain: Ex. we have 16GB (2x8). The "16GB" is the total memory capacity this total memory capacity is divided into 2 different RAM sticks each one with 8GB capacity. (Think carefully which kit you choose since your Motherboard has limited RAM slots).2. Which RAM to choose? one that does not exceeds the Motherboard's max **Memory Capacity** and that is the right **Memory Type** for your motherboard while also making sure the RAM can run with the CPU. Another pro-tip: google "best ram for \[CPU of your choosing\]".3. Remember about **Single** **Dual** and **Quad Channel.** Be sure to check if both the motherboard and CPU are compatible with Dual Channel and/or Quad Channel.4. Once you have chosen a RAM brand and want to increase your RAM **Memory Capacity** you have buy the same brand of RAM and RAM Model.5. You can freely choose the RAM's Aesthetics you like the most (also RAM can be more expensive just because they have RGB). There is a catch though look up if any Brand's RAM model has any known issue with certain motherboards or CPUs. Since looks might be deceiving.&#x200B;**Sixth Part: Storage**Probably the simplest part SSD is a lot more faster and expensive than the HDD so much faster that if you have an SSD and you don't install windows on the SSD you must really enjoy looking at your OS booting up.1. SSD is faster for gaming yes game loading times is not mainly determined by GPU its by storage drives. But SSD gets expensive as you get more Storage capacity so you can have SSDs and HDDs both in the same motherboard if your motherboard has the designated storage slots for the drives.2. Look for these terms: **Form Factors for Storage Drives SSD HDD Write/Read speed Random write/read IOPS.**3. Check special features for each individual storage drive from each brand.&#x200B;**Seventh Part: Cooler**This will be long because of all the different things to cover.First of all Search what OverClocking a CPU is. You don't need to know how to OverClock yet as it also depends on which CPU you chose but if you are interested in OverClocking I recommend you learn how a CPU Clocks and Voltages works together then you learn how to OverClock.Answer these questions:|||**Does your CPU comes with a stock cooler?**|||:-|:-|:-|:-|||Yes||No|||**Do you plan on OverClocking your CPU?**||You *must* buy a Cooler||Yes||No|||*Highly recommended* to buy a Cooler||You don't *need* to buy a Cooler||(If you are reading from mobile there is a table that won't properly show. The table determines whether you should buy or not a cooler based on your plans)\*If you don't want/need to buy a cooler you can skip to the next part\*There are Air Cooler and Water Cooler (AIO). AIOs are water coolers already built that will only require screwing to mount and do not take up much space perfect for RGB builds. However AIOs might not fit your Case and some Air Coolers are not compatible with your motherboard.1. First choose if you are going with Air Cooling or AIO both are good ways to cool the hottest of CPUs so don't think Water is worthless or Air is worthless.2. Check out which cooler you like the most and take these into consideration: How much they can cool the CPU during load and idle times while considering how much noise (dBA) they produce the harder they have to work to cool the CPU. (The amount of noise is personal preference if you want a quieter place or don't mind the little noise)3. After choosing one make sure it fits your case and/or it is compatible with your motherboard. Best way to check this is looking for Reviews Youtube videos for the specific case and cooler or asking on Reddit or the Cooler's webpage might provide that information. (Yes if you know the measurements of the case and the Coolers it should fit but there could be some exceptions or a little piece from the inside which will block the cooler best bet is the 3 previous suggestions).Notice: I do not talk about custom water cooling there is no specific way to install it so you would have to carefully measure and get the individual parts. Also installing such cooler is a lot harder very expensive and you would have to really enjoy working hard to give it maintenance. I would suggest you stick with traditional coolers.&#x200B;**Eighth Part: Power Supply Unit**Hopefully the webpage you chose to build your PC is able to estimate your fully built PC's Watts consumption from this estimate you will choose a proper PSU. Before we go on forget anything you read about PSUs this part has a lot of mixed "opinions". Once you read more and more about PSU you can have your own opinion about PSUs.1. Look what are the differences between a **Fully Modular** **Semi Modular** and **Non Modular** PSU. (**Fully Modular** becomes more expensive but opens up for more compatibility and any future parts upgrade this is a very important thing to consider however you might not need a **Fully** nor a **Semi Modular** PSU).2. It is important to check the PSUs Certification. Any Certified PSU is a safe choice you might want to read why PSU are certified and what each type of certification means.3. Now like any other part PSUs also comes in with different features depending on the brand and their different models. Also keep in mind the most important things to look in a PSU is the amount of output pin slots and the size of the PSU will fit your case.&#x200B;**Monitor**You sure have one in mind but listen carefully read about every terms in a monitor know what those **1ms Response Time** and **144hz Refresh Rate** you often see on the specifications mean.1. Be mindful when choosing a Monitor Size a 27" 1080p monitor looks like it has less Resolution than a 24" 1080p monitor and this is because of the **PPI.** Look up what that is and then you can have an idea of what would be the ideal **Monitor Size** and **Resolution.**2. There are 3 different panels for monitors: **IPS VA** & **TN.** Each of this panels offer different functionality. It is something important to take into consideration.3. Now if your GPU has an **HDMI 2.0** to fully take advantage of your GPU get a Monitor with an **HDMI 2.0** maybe your GPU has **DisplayPort 1.4** which offers more bandwidth than **HDMI 2.0** then you would want to consider buying a monitor with **DisplayPort 1.4.** Look all about the different Video Connectivity Protocols. Keep in mind that you don't need to have the exact same protocol on both ends for Ex.: You can connect the DisplayPort cable from the 1.4 on your GPU into the 1.2 into your Monitor and work fine.4. Again each Brand and their models have different features and design look around which one you like the most.&#x200B;That is all about the crucial parts of a PC you can then add another GPU or another case fan or a toy even a toy like an anime figurine or whatever seems to be trendy now a day.Hopefully you found this useful in any way possible and I would be a very proud to know you read everything just to build your PC your "Baby" if you will.&#x200B;I'll leave these useful web pages that I personally think you should know about while building a PC.[CPU-world.com](https://cpu-world.com/) \- Use this to check out all information about a certain CPU. (Don't let the weird names and numbers scare you)[Pangoly.com](https://pangoly.com/) \- A website to Build your PCs and is also very good when you want to compare different part options.Obviously you can also use YouTube and Reddit for reviews and/or specific questions comparisons and statistics.&#x200B;Please consider leaving any kind of feedback if there is something that should be reviewed/changed on this guide do let me know so I can work on it ensure this guide as flawless as possible. Other than that comment anything you did like as always following this subreddit's rules I will be more than happy to read all comments/questions. I would also appreciate anyone else answering other users questions as you would be helping me out while I am busy on something else.&#x200B;*Message for this post: Some may have felt let down by the guide most of you appreciated it and I did not expect this guide to blow up like this. I personally made this from my own experience and my goal was to encourage people to research everything themselves when building a PC. when I did it myself I enjoyed it very much. The title seems misleading yes it is a lot of "google this and that" and less of a glossary for you to know what each thing is. But I am not going to leave it like this. Thanks to all the feedbacks I have been getting in the comments all the incorrect points and other points I missed I will fix them and soon enough this guide should be good for anyone reading this. I ask you to not stop commenting out these important details let us together finish this guide after all I started to grow fond of the* r/buildapc *subreddit and I want the best for everyone here. Thank you all for the support and critics.*"
"I had built my PC at the beginning of December but I didn't realize that there are literally no GPUs on the market so I rolled with my old GTX 770 2GB while spamming F5 in shops everyday not only to stumble onto something that is actually available but also at a price that I can pay without having to sell my wife and son to human traffickers. Finally after a month I landed Gigabyte RTX 3070 Vision. Extremally pumped I teared the box apart and started to install it only to found out that... I can't install it. Length was OK for my case but no matter what I did it would just not fit into PCIE slot. Yup I thought after all of this. Busted card. Crooked PCIE... or maybe busted mobo even better. I tried couple more times used force if it breaks so be it (I was pretty pissed). Then I just give up took the card out and went for the box to pack it and send it back. While putting it into box - guess what you probably guessed it - there is big plastic black protective plug on PCIE connector.Who almost broke his card and mobo trying to fit chunk of protective plastic into PCIE slot???This guy! 👉🤡👈"
"So I'm an idiot. I was trying to put Windows 10 on an external hard drive because I lost the original thumb drive. Like an imbecile I pulled out my 1TB hard drive that had the last 10 years of my life on it and ran the installer from the Microsoft website. Graduation photos college videos my nudes: All gone.Don't do what I did.Edit 1: rip inbox lmao. I went to sleep early so I now see I have a few recovery options. Hopefully I don't have to fork over money to a service. I appreciate everyone's help! I'll be sure to store more of my nudes on there when I'm done :3"
"It's crazy how this card still holds up to this day.. the amount of value you get from it for a 2017 GPU that can still compete to some of the latest cards... just a train of thought.."
"This is an update for my original post I posted yesterday. I'm refraining from saying who the retailer or carrier were due to not knowing if it breaks the subreddit's rules.TLDR the carrier dropped it off somewhere that was not my front door. After talking to both the retailer and the carrier the retailer told me they are not able to reship the item for me because it is out of stock. When I asked if they can reship it when the 3070 comes back in stock they said the system would not let them. So the only option I had left was to take a refund.I'm pretty devastated and discouraged that this happened. I was so close to receiving the 3070 and building my first PC but it looks like I will have to wait a while... :(Edit 1: Wow I didn't expect this post to blow up a bit. Thanks for the kind and encouraging words :')Edit 2: People wanted to know more info about what happened. My 3070 FE was supposed to arrive on Wednesday but it was delivered early on Saturday instead. On the delivery details it said "Garage Door" which is weird bc I live in a townhouse and my garage does not have a street number anywhere near it. I went to check around my door garage and a good chunk of my neighborhood to see if it was misplaced somewhere but I couldn't find it. I ended up calling both the retailer and carrier and talked to them for hours. However today the retailer told me there is nothing they can do about the lost package and they gave me the refund instead"
"*EDIT/PREFACE: The issue here is that the motherboards that contain a series 100 chipset are natively incompatible with Intel's 7th generation CPU's (Kaby Lake). This can be fixed with a BIOS update of the suspect motherboard.**Not all motherboards with the 100 series chipset will have the updated BIOS upon shipment.**If you buy a Kaby Lake CPU and a 100 series chipset motherboard that does not have the BIOS updated at the factory* **then you cannot use that motherboard unless you have a spare Skylake CPU lying around that you can pop in and flash the BIOS with then go back to your Kaby Lake CPU.***There's a chance that you will be lucky and recieve a motherboard that has the updated BIOS but there's no surefire way to tell unless the retailer explicitly states that the BIOS at the latest revision with Kaby Lake support.**I recommend a motherboard with the B250 chipset for any multiplier-locked Kaby Lake and a motherboard with the Z270 chipset for any multiplier-unlocked Kaby Lake.*Just yesterday there were 4 posts where people had put together their systems and everything turned on but no display because they purchased a 100 series motherboard with a Kaby Lake CPU.*Just yesterday I and multiple other members had to warn at least 15 people who's builds included a 100 series chipset with a Kaby Lake CPU. None of them had any idea it was an issue.Are the 200 series chipsets really that unknown? I don't understand why anybody would pair the newest CPU with an older chipset considering the Kaby Lake/200 series were released alongside each other for the purpose of being used together just like the Skylake/100 series.PCPP does offer a warning but it's not nearly large enough. Even then people will still ignore it.This is happening way too often and a lot of people are getting screwed over after having unboxed their components only to have them not work after building the system up and plugging it in. Then they spend hours troubleshooting every component reseating everything - completely oblivious to the fact that they received a 100 series motherboard with an old BIOS.This is a pretty significant issue and it's unacceptable how many times this is occurring."
"Then you put your hand over the exhaust and nod approvingly at all that heat you’re removing from the case."
"Well...

"I know very little about computers but I want to try and do this because I know it would mean a lot to my boyfriend. I've heard him mention words like "144 fps 1440P" and "Doom Eternal". I may splurge on the graphics card coming out in October (3070) but I am not sure if it is necessary. I also heard him talk about new processors coming out soon? Thoughts? I am just not sure what a solid option would be. My price range is pretty wide because I want him to really like it (and I don't know what that costs)! I know his own computer is really old so he would be grateful for anything new but I want it to be a pc dream for him. After many hours looking at this page YouTube videos and general google searches I have put together the list below. Any guidance would be appreciated. Also please let me know if I am missing a part.

"So I bought some 3200Mhz Ram sticks a while back only to find out today that they had been running at 2133Mhz (yikes big oof). I was watching a video from  [**JayzTwoCents**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWQ0gDrqOCarmUKmppD7GQ) and at a point in the video he was talking about XMP. I was like: "Did I even enable XMP". Turns out I didn't. Enabling it really made a difference. Easiest way to gain (or lose) frames ever.EDIT: Wow guys thanks. I don’t know what happened. Just woke up and apparently this post blew up. I want to add a few notes to my post. Hopefully this will answer some of the questions in the comments. I’ll also try to answer some of them 1 by 1.- What is XMP (sometimes DOCP or EOCP): Just as you are able to overclock a cpu you can overclock your RAM (example: changing the frequency from 2133 to 3200). If you want to do it manually you have to change timings and voltage and just wait if your pc is stable or not. XMP (eXtreme Memory Profile) is the easy way of doing it. If you bought a 3200Mhz advertised module recently chances are it’s currently running at a lower speed. So most of the time RAM does not run at those higher clock speeds out of the box. You can use CPU-Z to find out what speed you RAM is currently running at.- Should I enable XMP: The difference can vary. Some report unstable systems. Others gain up to 15 frames per second in various games. You can always try it and revert back if you find out your pc is unstable. Using XMP won’t void RAM warranty but can void CPU warranty. If do not want to void warranty ask your cpu manufacturer if it’s okay to use the higher frequency with you CPU. Other than that no harm in trying. XMP is very safe.- How to enable XMP: First restart your pc and mash the F2/DEL button (varies per manufacturer) get to the BIOS menu. For me it was under the memory section. eXtreme Memory Profile (XMP): enabled."
"Admins if this doesn't belong here I will remove but not quite sure where else to share.So I have had this client for ohh 15 years plus. Lovely old retired gentleman. He was a electrical engineer and still really into his tech stuff. Latest software up to date hardware  you name it he had it. He past away 2 weeks ago at age 83. His widow contacted me and asked me to cleanup all his toys and sell what I can. Spent most of Friday morning unplugging and disconnecting his stuff. Easy really everything was neatly wired and labeled. Took his PC home and started cleaning his drives  when it hit me I am deleting part of a guy I respected loved his hobby and spend countless enjoyable hours discussing the pro and cons of hardware and software.  Fucking onionsRest easy Bruce._______________________________________This blew up way beyond what I intended. Just for the record. The way I went about it was first to set up his widow with her laptop and through his photosdocuments and everything else that she might have thought was important. She copied it to a portable drive and then I deleted his Dropbox and other online bits and bobs. It was easy as he kept a log of whatever he did with his PC backups...all logged  every change he made was written in his logbook. That took a day or two. I then went back made sure she is happy with what she had. Only then did the formatting  start. Out of respect I never took a look at what he had on those drives. Photos tax records personal stuff never even glanced. Games he played....some fond memories. Microsoft Office...he had major problems with it it did not work the way he wanted to work. Yeah brought back the memories.  Anyways I am glad for everyone that read this story about Bruce. As long as someone somewhere remembers him  that is all I can hope for."
"A good friend of mine have upgraded from gtx 1080 to rtx 3080. I am very happy for him and I asked what gpu he had before. It was an gtx 1080 which he would sell for $350-ish but I offered 200 and said it would still be in our family. He is the best friend you could get and we often trade other things like old consoles and yu-gi-oh cards. But now..... I had a ryzen 2200g and without a graphics card. I am very happy just to get this used one. I also pitched some money in to a NVMe and some other used Rams together with a r5 3600. Now it went straight from a very low budget build to a gaming rig. Couldn't be happier."
"You may remember [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/m7wj0e/i_need_the_ugliest_practical_atx_case_possible/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from a while back where I asked for submissions for some ugly ass cases to gift to a friend with a full build inside. We looked through every single post and collectively the favorite idea amongst The Boys™ ended up being from u/fuddyduddyc  which was to get a bright vivid pink case and sticker bomb the shit out of it. It's finally (almost) finished!  Ignore/excuse my messy basement. [Prepare the eye bleach! ](https://imgur.com/a/MQpuG6v) And yes that fan is off center on purpose. It bothers me and that makes me happy for him. Unfortunately there's some bad news. We didn't end up getting a GPU. We had planned a ryzen 5 3600 and a 2060 super. We actually ended up with a 3700x but the GPU we were after ended up not happening as it had to go to another build (to someone who was waiting for their PC). Since this one is a surprise with no timeframe and I had to pick one or the other I decided to use that card in the other friend's PC as I didn't want to keep him waiting for an undefined amount of time. I'm in the middle of a total of five builds right now for friends of mine. Some of it I'm paying for myself some of it I'm just doing the build but I've got two at present that need GPUs and unfortunately this is one of them. It may be a while before he ends up getting this because I'm stretched pretty thin financially at the moment so disappointingly I don't have the reaction video I wanted to do. Anyway we opted not to clear coat the stickers so he *can* remove them if he wants to but at the cost of an hour or two of scraping and frustration and he'll still be left with a vivid pink case and surprise ugly cable management when he takes the glass panel off! We also disconnected the front button that changes the lighting so he's stuck with the terrible color cycling default preset. Wanted to say thanks to the 1600+ comments I got on the last post. I didn't expect more than a couple dozen and I can't wait to show him that thread when we eventually get it to him."
"My friend is building a PC when shortages stop and asked for my help. Is this a good enough explanation for what CPU names mean?#Let’s understand numbers firstTo do this let’s split them into 3 parts• Last two digits• Third digit from the right• Everything else on the leftFor example: **5**|**6**|**00**|xor**10**|**9**|**00**|k**Now what these parts mean FROM LEFT TO RIGHT****First** is what generation CPU is from. Latest one at the time of writing for intel is 11th that is releasing right now and for AMD it’s 5**Second** one is probably most important. It shows model line it is in. Here are what this number usually means:1 - cheapest one3 - budget but can perform quite good4 - usually cheapest 6 core CPU. Best value most of the time5 - in between 4 and 6. Not that popular but a good choice nonetheless.  6 - The most popular choice. Often shares gaming performance with CPUs above it7 - not that different from 6 but has more cores. Recommended if you stream/record a lot.8 - faster than 7 but otherwise identical to it.9 - The best. Costs a lot thought.**Third** set is usually ‘00’. These should not bother you unless you are picking a $6000 editing PC as these usually are used to show that a CPU is a better than highest CPU with 00 for example 10950k is better than 10900k. Or 3950x is better than 3900x. So in the end you can probably ignore these.#Now let’s understand letters**AMD:**No letter - normal CPUX - a little bit faster than non-x counterpartXT - a slight upgrade to X. Usually released not long before next generation as sort of “Definitive edition”G - has integrated graphics but is based on older generation. The older generation part might not be correct as of end of 2021.S - low power desktop with integrated graphics **Intel:**No letter - normal CPU with no overclockingK - can be overclocked (with Z motherboard)F - no integrated graphics. Usually are cheaper.S - special editionE - embedded (will be made for a long time)T - low powerXE - extreme editionKF and KS are mixes of 2 lettersLaptop chips have their own system of letters but it’s not really relevant here#What stand-alone number meansThere is always a standalone number as wellFrom my experience it’s usually:3 - budget5 - average (?)7 - enthusiast9 - the highest end possible#Additional notes:AMD doesn’t have 4th gen desktop CPUs. Well technically they do but they are all OEM and even if you manage to find them they are based on third generation with only difference being added integrated graphics and offer no advantage if you have discrete GPUTo find which company made CPU look at box and name. Intel has “Core i” in beginning of name and AMD has “Ryzen”. Also former has blue box while later has red-ish orange.There are differently numbered CPUs for both brands - Pentiums Athlons etc. However you probably don’t want to put them in a gaming rig as they are slower.Edit: added part about standalone numbers which was originally in first one. Completely rewrite some parts. Thanks for all the feedback so far!Edit2: sorry if I can’t answer/ can’t implement all fixes instantly. I just came home from school and will try and update the whole thing more often.Edit3: the first part that was confusing was rearranged and reworked in some places.Edit4: a lot of minor improvements have been made here and there#Edit5: motherboards one [is out! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/mngd5p/motherboards_specifications_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Feel free to give feedback on what I can improve! :D"
"Just ranting. I'm stuck with my old GTX 960. Now I'd be more than happy if I could get my hands on even a GTX 1660 to get some decent FPS on new titles on my 1080p monitor. But lo and behold even a budget card from 2 years ago is out of stock... My best bet at this point is going for a used 960 for an SLI config.EDIT: I'm in the UK"
"Building a computer for a novice could be extreme scary: you spend a lot of money for every part of you computer and you are scared as hell to break something. The truth is that computer parts are not as fragile as you think most of them are built to be resistant. Just do everything while your computer is turn off. Look a tutorial on YouTube and learn everything about building a computer and so on. Use your first build to improve your knowledge about and you will find it less scary and more intuitive in the future. But remember: if you are scared to even touch your gpu cpu and so on just don't. Be careful but not scared."
"**BIG and perhaps final edit (I'll still be responding to comments/messages below) (I also made a small edit at the bottom)**ASUS has publicly responded.   [https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1](https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1)&#x200B;TLDR: Admitted compromise.  They said only a version of Live Update for NOTEBOOKS were affected not desktops.This is despite previous news articles so I apologize for any confusion.  ASUS offered their own zipped tool to check your machine for infection [here](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps_for_Win10/ASUSDiagnosticTool/ASDT_v1.0.1.0.zip).  The newest Live Update version 3.6.8 is fixed and is no longer compromised.  It includes multiple security mechanisms along with end-to-end encryption.  They also said they have strengthened their server-to-end-user software architecture but did not disclose how (usually you don't want to tell your adversary what you're doing to protect yourself so I understand).In the end if the "here" link/zip file above shows your machine was infected ASUS states the following:*Immediately run a backup of your files and restore your operating system to factory settings. This will completely remove the malware from your computer. In order to ensure the security of your information ASUS recommends that you regularly update your passwords.*&#x200B;I hope this finally puts and end to this.  Make sure you're updated to the latest version regardless of Desktop or Laptop software.  Thank you all for the comments&#x200B;**ASUS has responded to me:** Hi GadgetryTech thanks for reaching out to our team. We do apologize for the inconvenience and will be more than happy to assist. ASUS Live Update is a proprietary tool supplied with ASUS notebook computers to ensure that the system always benefits from the latest drivers and firmware from ASUS. A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group. ASUS customer service has been reaching out to affected users and providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed.ASUS has also implemented a fix in the latest version (ver. 3.6.8) of the Live Update software introduced multiple security verification mechanisms to prevent any malicious manipulation in the form of software updates or other means and implemented an enhanced end-to-end encryption mechanism. At the same time we have also updated and strengthened our server-to-end-user software architecture to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future.Additionally we have created an online security diagnostic tool to check for affected systems and we encourage users who are still concerned to run it as a precaution. The tool can be found here:[https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps\_for\_Win10/ASUSDiagnosticTool/ASDT\_v1.0.1.0.zip](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps_for_Win10/ASUSDiagnosticTool/ASDT_v1.0.1.0.zip)&#x200B;**Edit 5 for clarity:**This only affects ASUS machines running Live Update that was downloaded between June and November of 2018.  That puts approximately 3-4 million machines sold by ASUS in that time frame in addition to downloads from the web.  It's likely that this malware is on your machine but is dormant because only 600 specific MAC addresses would trigger the next stage of the malware.  As of now even if you have the malware it's likely not doing anything.  Instead this exposes a huge security oversight and example of attacking at the vendor/source level.&#x200B;**Original Post:**I posted this on /r/Hardware but received a message thinking it would be good for the BuildaPC community as well which I agree.&#x200B;Hi everyoneI did a post instead of just a link because it's important to discuss details and most people do not read articles just headlines. Anyway here's the link first:[https://motherboard.vice.com/en\_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers)And a second more technical/less fluff link from Kaspersky themselves: [https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/](https://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/)&#x200B;**Important Note:** According to the articles Asus has not been responsive to Kasperky regarding this incident. They still have yet to notify any customers as well.&#x200B;This malicious activity seems to have been noticed since late last summer by folks in the [/r/Asus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asus) community: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/8qznaj/asusfourceupdaterexe\_is\_trying\_to\_do\_some\_mystery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/8qznaj/asusfourceupdaterexe_is_trying_to_do_some_mystery/)&#x200B;**Summary:** It appears the attackers compromised an Asus Live Update server a long time ago to get an old setup.exe binary. After weaponizing it they were able to digitally sign the malicious software with a valid Asus digital certificate. Certificates are a great way to slip past a lot of AV software.&#x200B;**Timeline and Scope:** Starting last year it looks like this malicious payload was pushed for at least 5 months. It is estimated that at least 500000 computers were/are infected.&#x200B;**Indicators (do not visit these do not go to IP)***Http is replaced with Hxxp on purpose don't go to these sites. .com is replaced with \[.\]com for the same reason.*Kaspersky Lab verdicts for the malware used in this and related attacks:* HEUR:Trojan.Win32.ShadowHammer.genDomains and IPs:* asushotfix\[.\]com* 141.105.71\[.\]116Some of the URLs used to distribute the compromised packages:* hxxp://liveupdate01.asus\[.\]com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps\_for\_Win8/LiveUpdate/Liveupdate\_Test\_VER365.zip* hxxps://liveupdate01s.asus\[.\]com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps\_for\_Win8/LiveUpdate/Liveupdate\_Test\_VER362.zip* hxxps://liveupdate01s.asus\[.\]com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps\_for\_Win8/LiveUpdate/Liveupdate\_Test\_VER360.zip* hxxps://liveupdate01s.asus\[.\]com/pub/ASUS/nb/Apps\_for\_Win8/LiveUpdate/Liveupdate\_Test\_VER359.zipHashes (Liveupdate\_Test\_VER365.zip):* aa15eb28292321b586c27d8401703494* bebb16193e4b80f4bc053e4fa818aa4e2832885392469cd5b8ace5cec7e4ca19&#x200B;**What can you do?**For an automated cleanup and check here's a tool from Kaspersky to check for the Shadow Hammer infection: [https://kas.pr/shadowhammer](https://kas.pr/shadowhammer)For manual cleanup I would make sure your live update tool is the newest version if you intend to continue using it. Remove and clean any prior version of the update tool prior to installing the new one. A good method is to boot into safe mode remove the tool and check c:/ProgramData and your AppData folders (3 main ones) for anything to do with Asus live update. Remove those then reboot and install a clean updated.&#x200B;**Best practice (edited to include comments around laptops):**Auto-update tools from various vendors can always be used as a weaponized payload delivery mechanism just like a compromised website. It's best to stick to reputable sources for items like drivers or anything that gets root access to your system kernel. For graphics drivers only use AMD Nvidia and Intel sites directly (unless you have a laptop). Same with Intel NIC drivers chipsets etc. Please note that some laptops require vendor specific drivers for hardware to work properly which will bring you to sites like Dell Lenovo HP Toshiba etc. I hope this helps you all in protecting yourself!&#x200B;I am posting this in Hardware Intel AMD and Asus subreddits to spread awareness.Edit 1: Apparently the ASUS Z390 chipset UEFI can copy files to your drive once Windows is installed even if you did not do so yourself.

It's perhaps a future target but no sign of infection outside of Live Update.  Kaspersky is still unsure of what would happen in the second phase of attack or what the attackers planned on doing with the specifically targeted machines."
"So yeah this is embarrassing.  I am 6'2 200lbs very normal size.  Good hygiene blah blah.Whenever I play video games my ass sweats immensely.  Literally as I type this it feels like there was just a rain storm on my asshole.  I am sure the chair I use which is cheap and thick on the bottom kind of creates a furnace from sitting for long periods of time.Perhaps a chair with a meshy or more breathable bottom would suit me better but I also don't want to buy a cheap piece of shit chair either.Any help would be great because I am sick of having to wipe my ass during loading screens.  I could seriously water a small flower garden just by pulling down my pants and twerking above it.  Also I do kind of have an hairy ass crack...I am sure that doesn't help but I have tried shaving it before and within a few days it feels like someone is punching my asshole with a sandpaper fist covered in sriracha.  So...I am not sure why I mentioned my hairy ass but perhaps there is some advice out there.  Like sprinkle some ketchup on my ass hair or something crazy I wouldn't think of.Please help.  My butt is wet.EDIT: Figures this would blow up and I get my first gold on a throwaway account.  Story of my sweaty ass life.  EDIT 2:  Apparently I am a big fat fuck and didn't know it."
"So recently I’ve been encountering some blue screens and I was going crazy. It happens at the most random times and ONLY happens when gaming. I was playing Warzone and noticed my PC BSOD’d so I was kinda worried something had gone wrong. Recently added a SSD to my system and changed my fans out. Honestly didn’t think it was either of those but maybe something was loose? I ran Furmark and CPU-Z over and over. Never went above 60c on the cpu or 70c on the gpu. Here is the meat and potatoes. I swore it was my PC. I set my ram to default 2133mhz and I reseated my CPU even checked out my 3080. Nothing was wrong.I went to the “Reliability Monitor” on Windows and saw this.https://i.imgur.com/hD0gFgW.pngIn the report an application was reconfigured and if you look Gameinput Redistributable was reconfigured at the same time. Time to try to recreate the scenario. It crashes again and takes me here.https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/sbs/windows/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors-5c62726c-6489-52da-a372-3f73142c14ad?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=USGives me little to no info other than 7 errors that can be anything. But the fact that the Gameinput Redistributable was reconfigured the same time my PC crashed is a little sus. I looked into it.“GameInput Redistributable is a Shareware software in the category Desktop developed by Microsoft Corporation.”Weird I uninstalled it https://i.imgur.com/QSRuOTX.pngRan Warzone and played for about 2-3 hours and no crashes. Amazing! Guess what? My GF and neighbor both were having this problem and this fix worked great. However today I hopped on and guess what? I crashed again. I was like oh man it really is my PC. Nope. Checked again it was the Gameinput Redistrubable. It for some reason was reinstalled onto my PC. What? What is MS doing? I can’t find any more info on what this actually does and why it’s in my PC to begin with. I at first assumed it was some sort of emulation for controllers or for Xbox related games. However with the application uninstalled my Xbox Series X controller still works as well as my keyboard and the 3 Xbox games I tried State of Decay 2 MS Flight Simulator and Halo. Literally nothing happened.I was also not updated completely but regardless the error still occurs. I literally cannot restart my PC without Gameinput Redistributable being reinstalled on my PC. So for now everytime I log on I have to uninstall it to play games on my PC it’s honestly a hassle and I’m still confused on how it installs to begin with. Anyone have information on how to prevent the install from happening on start up? I can’t find any specific file in my system for this to happen so I assume it is preloaded in the OS itself…MS really needs to fix this. At least allow me to prevent the installation. Tl;dr check your Reliability Monitor app to see why you’re crashing. It may not even be your PC. I'm just trying to play games :/Edit: ALSO again this is a post to check out reliability monitor it can help you. Also check your logs."

"#These are just my results using my PC with a certain benchmarking tool. YMMV. I encourage you to run your own tests as what may be true for my PC may not be for yours.Edit: I should make it clear that I am *not* testing how games run *across* the extra monitors -- just how framerates change with the monitors enabled.Also thanks so much for the gold!Edit 2: /u/Afteraffekt pointed out that the cause of the framerate drops when playing YouTube videos on the additional monitors is simply that they are being rendered along with the game and *not* that they are being displayed on the monitors. After testing this he seems correct. I've added the data from these extra two tests (8 and 9) below.---So I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6kh1td/will_a_2nd_monitor_lower_fps_even_when_inactive/) a few days ago and got some mixed responses. Most were saying that the difference would be marginal although [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6kh1td/will_a_2nd_monitor_lower_fps_even_when_inactive/djmubpq/) seemed certain that I would see stutters and significantly lower FPS in games with a second or third monitor.I decided to test this using Universe Sandbox ²'s benchmarking tool. Now the interesting thing with my setup is that the right monitor is actually connected to the motherboard (thus powered by my i5's iGPU) whereas the left and centre monitors are both powered by my GTX 1060 3GB. I ran ~~7~~ 9 different tests:1. Both side monitors disabled2. Right monitor disabled3. Left monitor disabled4. No monitors disabled5. YouTube video playing on left monitor6. YouTube video playing on right monitor7. YouTube videos playing on both side monitors8. One YouTube video playing in the background with both monitors disabled9. Two YouTube videos playing in the background with both monitors disabledMy system is using the following specs:- Case: Aerocool Qs-240 (with 2x Arctic F12 Silent 120 mm)- Motherboard: Asus H110M-R- CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 (SR2L6)- CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212X- RAM: 2x4 GB HyperX Fury DDR4 2133Mhz CL14 (in dual channel)- SSD: Samsung 850 Evo 250GB- GPU: EVGA GTX 1060 SC 3GB- PSU: Corsair VS550 550W 80+I should also note that Shadowplay was running throughout all of these tests. I tried to keep things as consistent as possible but high repeatability will always be difficult to obtain with benchmarks due to the unpredictable nature of PC components. I kept Steam offline during all of my tests to prevent any stutters due to notifications and the only other program I had running in the background of my PC was EVGA Precision XOC (which I use to set a custom fan curve on my GPU).Anyway here are my results:#Test 1 -- no additional monitors enabled- Run 1: 121 avg. FPS- Run 2: 123 avg. FPS- Run 3: 122 avg. FPS- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 121-123**#Test 2 -- one additional monitor powered by the GPU- Run 1: 120 avg. FPS- Run 2: 122 avg. FPS- Run 3: 123 avg. FPS- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 120-123**#Test 3 -- one additional monitor powered by the CPU- Run 1: 123 avg. FPS- Run 2: 122 avg. FPS- Run 3: 122 avg. FPS- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 122-123**#Test 4 -- both additional monitors enabled- Run 1: 122 avg. FPS- Run 2: 123 avg. FPS- Run 3: 121 avg. FPS- **Average: 122 FPS | Range: 121-123**#Test 5 -- YouTube video playing on left monitor which is powered by the GPU- Run 1: 119 avg. FPS- Run 2: 120 avg. FPS- Run 3: 121 avg. FPS- **Average: 120 FPS | Range: 119-121**#Test 6 -- YouTube video playing on right monitor which is powered by the CPU- Run 1: 118 avg. FPS- Run 2: 117 avg. FPS- Run 3: 116 avg. FPS- **Average: 117 FPS | Range: 116-118**#Test 7 -- YouTube videos playing on both additional monitors- Run 1: 115 avg. FPS- Run 2: 116 avg. FPS- Run 3: 115 avg. FPS- **Average: 115 FPS | Range: 115-116**#Test 8 -- one YouTube video playing in the background no side monitors enabled- Run 1: 118 avg. FPS- Run 2: 115 avg. FPS- Run 3: 114 avg. FPS- **Average: 116 FPS | Range: 114-118**#Test 9 -- two YouTube videos playing in the background no side monitors enabled- Run 1: 114 avg. FPS- Run 2: 114 avg. FPS- Run 3: 116 avg. FPS- **Average: 115 FPS | Range: 114-116**#Conclusion: #Using extra monitors does not appear to affect FPS in any way even when content is being displayed on them -- the lower FPS seen in tests 5/6/7 are due to the videos being rendered *NOT* due to them being displayed on the additional monitors. (The FPS appears just as low if not lower when the videos are playing in the background with the side monitors disabled.)Honestly I was expecting a much larger difference. I should note that Universe Sandbox ² is probably more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive which could explain the lower FPS when powering the monitor with the iGPU.Hope this helps some people!---Additional notes I'm adding to try and eliminate any confusion: - The videos were played with the default YouTube layout i.e. not full-screen or in 'cinema mode'. I did this specifically because I felt more people viewed videos like this but I apologise if this was incorrect of me. - The side monitors are both 1366x768 in resolution and the centre monitor is 1680x1050. Both monitors run at 60Hz. Some have suggested that mixing monitors with different refresh rates can cause microstutters which /u/Kezz92 claims can be fixed by disabling Aero transparency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6le4kr/do_extra_monitors_really_lower_fps_i_ran_a_series/djtf3am/) but I do not have a high refresh rate panel I can use to test this. - The side monitors are completely inactive for tests 2-4 -- simply displaying my desktop background (which is simply a solid grey colour). When I say they are disabled I mean that I have disabled them within Windows (to the same effect as unplugging them)."

"Monday night I was feeling glum I couldn't get in on the cyber action when lo and behold I manifested a 3090 into existence. So I was talking to this guy & found out he worked at a Best Buy. He managed to cop 3090s to sell at MSRP receipt included so that bots wouldn't get em. Problem is he lived like 3 hours away. I only sort of have a car but I do have two bikes. I didn't have time to find a friend to adventure with I had to act quick. I rode my bike 3 hours to hopefully not get robbed in the freezing cold. On the way I stopped at the bank for cash. The teller asked if I was getting a vehicle. His face when I said it was for a graphics card was priceless. We were supposed to meet at a Best Buy and I got there like 40 mins late. The sun had set by now. It was so dark and I was kind of anxious but this guy really put me at ease. This gentle xmas angel was legit. The ride back was excrusiatingly brutal though. I stopped a couple times but it didn't matter. I was a block of ice in the howling wind. I was practically in shock when I got home. I was uncontrolably shaking and wrapped myself in as many dry blankets as I could. (a hot bath was tempting but it would have been too much). Despite the struggle it was so worth it. Over the next few days I upgraded my build to forge a raytracing ultra psycho lighting cyberpunk machine. As awesome as the game is sometimes it's the experience of a good build that is the real rush.[https://imgur.com/a/yBctLig](https://imgur.com/a/yBctLig)"
"DO NOT MIX MODULAR PSU CABLES THEY ARE NOT STANDARDIZED BETWEEN MANUFACTURERSI know a lot of people will be swapping their PSUs and taking the shortcut of disconnecting old PSU and plugging in their new one. Please do not do this!Unless you have standard replacement cables from CableMod or Corsair you're risking losing your components or worse.Testimonies:[I nuked two SSDs by using cables from a different PSU in my new PSU.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6igmaw/i_nuked_two_ssds_by_using_cables_from_a_different/)[Guys please learn from my mistake](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/6e336c/guys_please_learn_from_my_mistake/)[PSA: Stop Mixing Modular PSU Cables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDsC_PNo84I&feature=youtu.be) \-  Gamers Nexus[https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2702-psa-on-mixing-modular-psu-cables-dont-do-it](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2702-psa-on-mixing-modular-psu-cables-dont-do-it)&#x200B;EDIT:# FAQ\- What about Cable Extensions?Cable extensions use the "device side" of the connector which is always the same.

"So 2 years ago I decided to build a gaming PC and thought I was playing my games all this time in 144fps. Decided today to actually see how much fps I was getting in rocket league....wasn't getting above 60hz. Looked up a video on YouTube and apparently Windows had my 144hz monitor at 60hz by default. If anyone is like me and isn't an expert in building PCs this is a friendly reminder to check!Edit: Some people have been asking how to check this there is a comment below that tells you how but ill do it here...go to windows settings>display settings>scroll down to advanced display settings>click on Display adapter properties>go to the monitors tab> you'll see a drop down menu."
"A lot of the build help request we see on here is from people wanting to "max out" games but I generally find that this is an outdated term as even average gaming PCs are supremely powerful compared to what they used to be.[Here's a video that describes what I'm talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ZsaavKNR8)Maxing out a game these days usually means that you're enabling "enthusiast" (read: dumb) effects that completely kill the framerate on even the best of GPU's for something you'd be hard pressed to actually notice while playing the game. Even in comparison screenshots it's virtually impossible to notice a difference in image quality.Around a decade ago the different between medium quality and "ultra" settings was **massive**. We're talking muddy textures vs. realistic looking textures. At times it was almost the difference between playing a N64 game and a PS2 game in terms of texture resolution draw distance etc.[Look at this screenshot of W3 at 1080p on Ultra settings](http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/witcher3_03_Ultra.png) and then compare it to [this screenshot of W3 running at 1080p on High settings](http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/witcher3_03_High.png). If you're being honest can you actually tell the difference with squinting at very minor details? Keep in mind that this is a screenshot. It's usually even less noticeable in motion.Why is this relevant? Because the difference between achieving 100 FPS on Ultra is about $400 more expensive than achieving the same framerate on High and I can't help but feel that most of the people asking for build help on here aren't as prone to seeing the difference between the two as us on the helping side are. The second problem is that benchmarks are often done using the absolute max settings (with good reason mind) but it gives a skewed view of the capabilities of some of the mid-range cards like the 580 1070 etc. These cards are more than capable of running everything on the highest **meaningful** settings at very high framerates but they look like poor choices at times when benchmarks are running with incredibly taxing yet almost unnoticeable settings enabled.I can't help but feel like people are being guided in the wrong direction when they get recommended a 1080ti for 1080p/144hz gaming. Is it just me?TL/DR: People are suggesting/buying hardware way above their actual desired performance targets because they simply don't know better and we're giving them the wrong advice and/or they're asking the wrong question."
"Well /r/buildapc we just became a community of 2 million PC builders. To put that number in perspective there are more of you than the entire population of Latvia. It’s also 117647 of you per sentient moderator which is kinda terrifying.It’s time to celebrate the only way /r/buildapc knows how: partnering with some amazing hardware manufacturers and retailers to give away all kinds of PC related swag. Let’s get down to business.**What’s the plan?**Since /r/buildapc launched over two million posts have been submitted to /r/buildapc. Most of those are PSU tier lists and praise for PCPartPicker but a couple are genuine PC build posts - we want to find the best of them and reward the incredible efforts their owners have gone to.To do so we’re asking you to submit your Build Stories.

"Ditch that cheapest Western Digital Blue M.2 500Gb slapped on your PCpartpicker list it's just a fancy SSD and filter search by NVMe instead.   In the realm of storage there are 3 main options today: slow HDD fast SSD and very fast NVMe.    To get the speed of an NVMe your data is passed directly through the motherboard by inserting into an M.2 slot but this **speed also requires the NVMe drive** to pass that data along the PCIe lanes. Some M.2 sized storage do not have this driver and are just SSDs that fit in the M.2 slot rather than the standard 2.5" case. You are not paying for speed you are paying extra for small size. If you want the extra "M.2 speed" you actually want to search by NVMe.    Replace this: [Western Digital Blue 500 GB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive - **No NVMe** - $60](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/6j448d/western-digital-blue-500gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-wds500g2b0b)     With this: [Western Digital Blue SN550 500 GB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive - **YES NVMe** - $60](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zFK2FT/western-digital-blue-sn550-500-gb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-wds500g2b0c)    Edit: I appreciate all the information added to this discussion it is now much more in-depth than just M.2 ≠ NVMe so here are some other useful points added in the comments:     M.2 is a form factor (slot on the motherboard) like 2.5” is a form factor. NVMe is a drive like AHCI is drive (“SATA SSD” is commonly used to refer to ACHI driven storage because they connect to SATA ports) Both NVMe and SATA (AHCI) are solid state drive (SSD) for how they encode and store files different from the HDD dinosaurs. Not all M.2 are NVMe but *most* NVMe are M.2. Thank u/L00S33R top comment for this explanation and teaching me about U.2 drives.    DRAM also influences storage quality/speeds and can be present or not independent of NVMe drive. DRAM > no DRAM although I am not sure how this benefit interacts with NVMe or SATA SSD differently. Some of you brought up more factors that go into storage that I know nothing about… It can all get confusing just try to make a semi-informed choice    The speeds that can be reached with NVMe are not very beneficial for gaming outside of small load time improvements compared to SATA SSD but *may* be in the future if developers leverage the speed (which seems more likely with NVIDIA RTX IO in the 3000 series directly decompressing SSD to the GPU)"
"HelloI love this subreddit and all the help that people are willing to give out but one thing I've noticed remaining constant is that people are still recommending the RX 570/580 to users looking at budget focused PC's. 6 months ago this would be sound advice but the market has changed. The cheapest RX 570 per PCPP is $150 and a 1650 Super is only $10 more. The 1650 super uses less power and almost always outperforms the 570.580's are more expensive than the 1650 super and again is either on the same performance level or loses by 3-10% to the super while also using much more power.Unless you're going used (which can really save you some cash for the GPU) I just don't see how we can recommend the 570/580 at this time. The last thing I want for a new builder is for them to waste their money!Edit: I am not saying a 570/580 are bad. Just simply saying the market prices they are at (at least in the US) put them in a lower value category. And yes I'm aware of specific use cases but most builds we see come through here are for windows gaming PC's so that is what this is aimed at."

"So I was just randomly watching some Linus Tech videos on Youtube and then suddenly i heard this: "you should always put your gpu in your Primary/First PCIe Slot for maximum performance". That was the moment I realised that i had fucked up.I never thought that a 16 slot PCIe slot would not have 16 lanes necesserily.So this means i have been using my gpu on an x4 lane PCIe slot for 3 years...The difference is not VERY BIG and its as much as 5 to 15% in performance (personally I believe its a major difference) differing on different setups and cards.I had put my gpu in second PCIe for case space management reasons.So i just thought many others would be in a situation like me and never even know about it...my advice to you guys is that if you have your gpu on a Secondry PCIe slot check your mobo manual and make sure that your gpu is running at x16 lane.You can also use gpu z to check this."
"So I don't know if this helpful for anyone here but like many here I'm a PC Builder noob and maybe this can help someone.Just yesterday I was debating myself why I was not getting the performance in games that I was expecting to have.Then someone mention the Ram Speed. I have 3200 mhz (16 GB) the problem was when I checked the performance on the Task Menu the speed was at stuck at 2133 Mhz.What I learned was that by going to the BIOs and simply change the profile the problem was fixed ( I have an MSI motherboard so it can be different for you but if you have this problem search for a solution online and is probably not that different).Just to give you an example my GTA V went from average 70 FPS to around 95 no joke. This was the reason why I began this search because I knew that with my Specs I should have better performance.Hopefully this was helpful for some of you. Like I said I'm a noob so I can't help you much the idea of this post is more to raise awareness."
"After finally experiencing the upgrade from HDD to SSD myself this year it was painful to watch my mom wait 5-10 minutes on a cold boot for her computer to be usable. So I bought her a 240 GB Sandisk SSD (35 USD) from Best Buy for Christmas and plopped it in and cloned her old drive. The whole process took about 2 hours and her husband was on the verge of freaking out the entire time that I was going to break something.Now that it’s done however my mom with her basic Dell i3-6100 computer called me at 3 AM to tell me she hasn’t stopped using her computer since I left at 8 PM. She said she can’t believe how much more responsive everything is now and even her husband is impressed. But he thinks the speed up is partially because I blew a bunch of dust out of the CPU heat sink.She said now she might actually shut her computer off now at night instead of putting it to sleep since start up time is just as quick. If a loved one in your life is still using old HDDs do them a favor and bring them into modern hardware life with an SSD. Next gift idea small PCIe powered GPU so she doesn’t need to play Sims 3 on integrated graphics."
"Apologies if wrong subreddit. Loving my new 144Hz monitor but it had me wondering - what made all these manufacturers settle on 144? It's 24Hz times 6 right? That's the only reasonable multiple I can think of. But why settle at 144 and 165 instead of something higher or lower?"
"Hi I've started building a computer early this year. I built it for my home workstation and since then I've been buying a lot of stuffs to make my work-at-home experience more comfortable and fun (arm mounts ergonomic stuffs like keyboard trays and gaming chairs etc.). Now I'm at a point where I've bought everything I need but I'm still constantly thinking and browsing online shops and looking for the "PC Accessories" or even "Home Accessories" page to see if there's an item I forgot to buy or didn't know that exist but something that I would need.Do you guys also feel like this? It's like I'm already contented with how my setup is (or at least I think I do) but I still constantly look for something that I don't even know what's missing. How do you guys deal with this feeling?"
"Yesterday or the day before I don't remember. Someone made a post about their PC being slow after being unplugged by parents where I'm pretty sure the solution was that his HDMI was plugged into his Motherboard and not his GPU.[https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/odj5r6/pc\_slow\_after\_rough\_handling\_by\_parents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/odj5r6/pc_slow_after_rough_handling_by_parents/)&#x200B;Well this inspired me to take a look at my PC that I've had since 2017.&#x200B;And what do you know I have been gaming using my integrated graphics card since 2018.The HDMI port to the GPU was filled in with these plugs that I never noticed until yesterday.So I plugged the HDMI into the GPU and holy fuck I've never felt so retarded in my entire life.I have been gaming since 2017 on integrated graphics and not had any clue about it.Is this worse than buying a 144hz monitor and not changing the setting from 60hz for 4 years?Please before I am insulted too much I built this PC when I was 16 with 0 experience and no family to help me..... but god.... what an oversight.... fuck me&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;Update: Played some games last night RD2 Dota 2 Csgo. Honestly it didn't feel that different like my games look better but performance wise it wasn't that noticeable. &#x200B;&#x200B;I am thinking it's maybe possible that my PC was running using the dedicated graphics card the whole time? Would this be possible&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;"
"I just finished building my first computer a few days ago and I had a blast. Picking out the parts the anticipation of waiting for everything to arrive the slightly stressful thrill of putting it all together and then finally the high of success when you see it successfully boot up. The glow is starting to wear off and I don't even really want to play any games on my new computer; now all I can think about is building another one for my 7 year old daughter. Where is this hobby leading me? This isn't sustainable I can only build so many computers...EDIT: I just wanted to edit to add a couple things to address comments I keep getting:1. I'm definitely going to try out PC Building Simulator thanks for the suggestions!2. I'm sorry you don't like these kinds of posts. There are lots of comments and discussion happening so apparently some people like them. There's always the downvote button. :)3. I'm not into games that require a powerhouse computer. I'm more into strategy and RPGs; I don't play fast-twitchy FPS type games. The reason I built a "gaming" PC is because my laptop died on Christmas day and I'd been interested in building a PC that'd be capable of doing some gaming as well as photoshop and maybe some light 3D modeling.  4. I built a pretty modest computer. I spent less than $1000 USD on a build featuring a Ryzen 5 3600 and a second-hand RX 580 GPU (the rest of the build has more expensive components Gold PSU Noctua Cooler etc. I wanted the system to be easily upgradable).5. Lots of people mentioned woodworking! This is also something I'd love to do but I don't really have the room and the machines I'd want would be WAY more than I spent on this computer.6. There are a lot of comments about consumerism and while I pretty much agree with them and agree that I DO have fun spending money on stuff I feel like I get the most enjoyment from the creative process and making things. Speaking of the computers and the building/creative process I've been thinking about making a breadboard computer like [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater/playlists) does on his youtube channel. The playlist is great and learning about exactly how computers work is very satisfying. Highly recommended.7. Building computers for others is a great idea and building and reselling as a hobby and for extra cash sounds enticing. I'm already 40 though and I have a pretty good career in winemaking going so I don't think working at/opening a computer shop is really in the cards for me."

"I mainly play warzone and recently my temps have skyrocketed. I used to play at around 72 degrees but since the new season its been hovering around 80 while playing and my fans are maxed out and my pc sounds like a jet engine.

"I was looking around on facebook marketplace to see if anyone had a 4090 system built and for sale just out of pure interest. I saw some 4090 cards up there for $500AUD less than MSRP (still around $2800AUD) so I jumped on one. When I went to pick it up the address was an office. I assumed it was an employee who would just meet me in the hallway and sell it to me but when I went to reception and asked for the seller she said "do you have an appointment?" I explained the situation and she directed me to his office it turns out he was the CEO! It's a small/medium sized company that does esports consulting and he mentioned he needed someone to build PCs! Fast forward a few weeks and I now work on the weekends there assembling custom builds for him. Would have never expected that I would get a job out of thisEDIT: For anyone calling this fake check my most recent post: https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/zqccd8/proof_of_the_4090_got_me_a_job_story_for_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfEDIT #2: PC Part Picker list https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/2M4nJMEDIT #3: proof post got removed so here it is:Proof of the ‘4090 got me a job’ story for the people that don’t believe meJust wanted to add some proof because some people were calling it far fetched.Employment contract: https://imgur.com/a/6bUSXiUYes I know this could be a faked email I don’t want to reveal personal info so this is the best I can do.

"So I have made a website https://envybits.com/ that can build or upgrade computers automatically with some help of machine learning lots of data entry and quite a lot of coding and debugging.Now I know it's not yet optimal so I would like to see if you can beat it and what improvements/changes would you suggest (essentially check how it performs at different budgets and build types). Eg. if it recommends a really bad CPU/GPU combo in a given budget puts too little RAM etc. From my own tests it seems to be doing fine in most situations and can help out people new to it but would like it to be checked by you guys too. In particular "upgrading old computers" (also known as Upgrade Planner) is really hard to check by just myself.(Note - US prices are up to date rest of the world is unfortunately a bit out of date so I would refrain from using them too much).Some of you might remember me from last time - since then a lot of things have changed (for the better I hope!) and new features have shown up - mobile friendly UI Game Planner aimed for people who want to play a specific title but don't actually know what kind of computer will run it so they don't know how much they should spend and hopefully better treatment of microATX/miniITX builds."
"Hey guys! I know this is a subreddit about building not working with prebuilt systems. However I figured it might apply to people upgrading their systems or looking into whether they should buy or build.My friend has a fairly new iBuyPower PC and he's been seeing his CPU temps spike up to 100C and shut down his computer. I'm a bit of a repair guy so he asked me to take a look at it and see what's up. We had tried new thermal paste and checked the fans and nothing worked so I decided to look deeper. I found a pretty severe problem in the system itself and I wanted to shine a bit of a spotlight on it in case it can help anyone else.The major problem with these systems seems to be that the factory is filling them with the filthiest tap water they can find. I took the copper plate off the head of the CPU end so I could empty it fill it and watch the flow while it ran. (I only powered up the PC in short intervals so the CPU wouldn't overheat with no cooling system in place.) The first sign that something was wrong was that the chamber where the water flows from the inlet to the outlet had white gunk in it. It was also barely flowing when I powered it up. I refilled it and flushed it out several times using distilled water methanol (HEET from automotive stores is pure methanol easy to get) even Listerine. Each time the pump chugged and could barely move anything through. Eventually after about 4 flushes something broke loose and a bunch of white microbial crap all flooded out of the outlet. I flushed it out a couple more times and each time more stuff inside broke loose and the pump worked faster and faster. Eventually the liquid was coming out clean and the pump had gone from a slow sludgy trickle to pumping so fast that the water was sloshing out of the head cap.At that point I filled it up with a mix of 75% distilled water 25% HEET (for its antimicrobial properties and breaking of surface tension) and a squirt of racing supercoolant (anti-corrosion compounds). After I got everything reassembled the CPU was running cooler than it did brand new.If you get an iBuyPower PC I highly recommend replacing your coolant. If anyone is interested in the annoyingly long process I can post instructions in the comments. Unfortunately I didn't know it was going to be this big of a fustercluck so I didn't take pics as I went. Would have made an interesting case study."
"In January 2018 [I made a post in r/buildapc sharing my results from building a gaming PC with a *strict* budget of no more than $100.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7otdky/i_built_a_99_gaming_pc_and_benchmarked_it_in_a/) The final cost of that PC was $93 after an unexpected $6.49 refund on my 120 GB SATA1 2.5" HDD that I was able to keep. That post contains a detailed description of the parts why I chose them and their costs so please refer to that if you want the full information but otherwise here's a list of the parts via PCPartPicker and I've copied the price discussion from the last post as well:[A picture of the glorious beast.](https://i.imgur.com/noVMa6a.jpg)**Parts List**[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hmN9hq) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hmN9hq/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [Intel - Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.4GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/r4TmP6/intel-cpu-bx80562q6600) | Purchased For $14.00 **Motherboard** | Intel DG31PR LGA775 | Purchased for $15.00**Memory** | [Kingston - ValueRAM 4GB (2 x 2GB) DDR2-800 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/G3DwrH/kingston-memory-kvr800d2n6k24g) | Purchased For $14.00 **Storage** | [Samsung - Spinpoint M7 120GB 2.5" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/8WsKHx/samsung-internal-hard-drive-hm120gi) | Purchased For $0.00 **Video Card** | [EVGA - GeForce GT 740 4GB Superclocked Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/YVrG3C/evga-video-card-04gp43748kr) | Purchased For $20.00 **Case** | [Rosewill - STAR PREDATOR ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vt648d/rosewill-case-starpredator) | Purchased For $14.00 **Power Supply** | [Thermaltake - TR2 430W ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/47Qypg/thermaltake-power-supply-w0070) | Purchased For $16.00  | *Prices include shipping taxes rebates and discounts* | | **Total** | **$93.00** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2018-01-07 15:26 EST-0500 |**Pricing**The CPU MB RAM and CPU cooler were $43 as a combo from Ebay; they were listed at $35 + $10 shipping but I made an offer for $33 + $10 shipping to save $2. That seems like nit-picking but $2 is 2% of my budget! I split up their prices somewhat evenly on PCPartPicker but you can probably get a Q6600 for under $10 and the RAM for a similar price but the mobo is likely the most expensive part of that combo.The 120 GB SATA1 2.5" HDD was $6.49 shipped from Ebay but after 30 days I was strangely refunded in-full and the seller didn't reply to any of my messages so I technically got it for free. The GPU and PSU were listed as $60 on Craigslist but I literally messaged the seller and told them I was on a super strict budget and couldn't offer more than $36. Miraculously the seller took my offer. The case was my only non-used component. It was $24 on-sale from Newegg and had a $10 rebate making it cost me $14 which is amazing for a case that comes with three 120mm fans.**Overclocking**The GT 740 SC 4 GB DDR3 was overclocked for my original and second-round of benchmarking with +90/+200 using MSI Afterburner. No artifacting or crashing occurred with this overclock during any of my tests or just when I was playing Rocket League for fun :)The big change this time is I overclocked my Intel Core2Quad Q6600 (released in **2007!**) by 25% going from 2.4 GHz to 3.0 GHz. This was achieved by [putting a tiny piece of electrical tape over a single pin on the CPU aka a "BSEL" mod](https://i.imgur.com/9xo8uj0.jpg) which forces the CPU and motherboard to clock the CPU at 3.0 GHz! I initially thought that the stock Intel cooler wouldn't be able to handle that overclock but actually it was totally fine. This was really important because I didn't have enough room in my budget to buy an aftermarket cooler... remember I was sticking strictly to $100 or less!**Benchmarks****Average FPS at 720p:**Game|OC'd GPU (FPS)|OC'd CPU/GPU (FPS)|% change:----|:----|:----|:----Cinebench (CPU multithread) | 234 (score) | 296 (score) | +26%Fortnite | 59 | 64 | +8%PUBG | 28 | 33 | +16%DOOM (2016) Demo | 32 | 30 | -7%FF XIV: Stormblood Benchmark | 27 | 28 | +2%Counter-Strike: Source Benchmark | 275 | 298 | +8%Dirt 3 Benchmark | 114 | 132 | +16%Just Cause 2 Benchmark | 103 | 104 | +1%DOTA 2 | 86 | 101 | +18%Metro 2033 Benchmark | 42 | 46 | +9%Overwatch | 74 | 77 | +4%Rocket League | 88 | 87 | -1%Super Meat Boy | 60 | 60 | n/aWoW Vanilla: Northshire | 84 | 83 | -1%WoW Vanilla: Ironforge | 51 | 54 | +6%WoW Vanilla: Magmadar's Cavern | 72 | 82 | +13%WoW Legion (Dalaran) | 38 | 41 | +8%*All tests were conducted in triplicate and results were averaged*   **[Album of benchmark results including 1% and 0.1% lows at 720p 900p and 1080p.](https://imgur.com/a/8BMBAN8)**The system was way better than I anticipated *especially* after the CPU overclock. Basically every game I tested was playable at 720p with PUBG being the only real exception (but even then we pulled 30 FPS average). Overwatch Rocket League and several older games were absolutely playable even at 1080p. I will say that I seriously had a blast playing Rocket League as I'd never tried it before this project (I bought the game *just* for benchmarking this PC) and it ran great. This project also got me to go re-live some of my older favorite games such as Just Cause 2.I have made [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id3K9pOGapU) that goes into a little more discussion about how the games ran as well as [my older video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHTt563xfk) that showed the parts and a build montage for anyone interested but almost everything you need to know is in this post or my older post. I actually completed this project a couple months ago but never had time to make this write-up or the accompanying video and in that time I re-sold the CPU MB RAM CPU cooler and GPU on Ebay which completely re-paid the $93 I spent on the build. I plan to sell the PSU and HDD later on but I'm keeping the case since it's really quite awesome to use for test-builds in the future.**tl;dr:** I built a PC using (mostly) used parts for under $100 and played a buncha games on it. I then overclocked the CPU by 25% using a piece of electrical tape and played the games again. I really enjoyed myself and plan to do this again in the future and really encourage you to do so too if you have an itch to build but don't "need" to build right now."
"As folks are well aware Zen 3 came out a couple of months ago. Since launch it has been beyond a crapshoot for most folks especially new builders to get. The only repeated advice folks tend to give em is **only** get a 5xxxseries CPU as if it is the only option. Considering it isn't really realistic to get at the moment and probably not for quite some time I wanted to let folks know you can get a different chip than that and be just fine.I know I know. "How DARE I go against the hive mentality and help folks who may want a nice build sooner!!! Reeeeee!!! Zen 3 is the only chip yada yada." I reality you can go Zen 2 or Intel 10th gen if you wanted and get close enough performance. Yes zen 3 beats other chips but not mindblowingly so especially at higher resolutions in most cases. GPU's are a different story and you can be better off at times spending more money there tbh. So if you're in the market and don't want to spam f5 sleep outside MC fight against bots wait several months play the discord game pay scalping price pay more for a chip you may not need and/or try to hit a lotto Gen 10 intel (on sale right now anyhow) and zen 2 at or lower than msrp (currently available at msrp) are good alternatives capable of reaching 144hz+ in many games. They will also be good for years to come despite what folks may say otherwise. If you want to just get a good build going and enjoy vs sitting around not a bad option. If you are okay with waiting around for some time or potentially overpaying then zen 3 may come around later this year or something. I went with previous gen as far as CPU's go you don't need to upgrade very often as they stay good for awhile for most folks. Due to this I can game at 144hz and not miss too much from single gen difference. Just letting folks know there are good alternatives to the hype alone."
"So basically my PC would not turn on. Tried everything I could. Finally decided to take it to a repair shop. The guy said that my PSU had short circuted and also damaged my motherboard. He suggested that my MOBO was damaged beyond repair and suggested some other motherboard.(this one is cheaper than my original one) Today I got a call and he told me that he would like to buy back my motherboard and PSU since he needs the parts.He offered to give me a 10% discount. The problem is that my motherboard is a a fairly expensive one. So is he tricking me into buying a new one so he can keep the old one?The other red flag was when he contacted me and told me that my Windows had some corrupted files and he had to reinstall windows.Can a MOBO issue affect Windows? He's also telling me that all my data will be wiped and he is asking me for an extra charge to retain it.I know this might not be the subreddit for this. I really don't know where else to go. Please helpEdit:OMG.I don't believe this is happening. Me and my cousin go to his shop. We had informed him about 30 minutes prior that I'm coming to see the parts. We go there now and ITS CLOSED! I called him immediately and he told me that he has a family emergency and is going to meet me later. I can't believe this. Is he talking it somewhere to extract the parts?......I seriously don't know what to do.Edit 2: Ok I called him back and threatened to take action of I found anything missing or damaged. He got a bit scared and told me he'd meet me soon. He even face timed me and he is in his home. He told me that my PCs in the store and is fine. I decided to give him until evening. If he doesn't return I might take some actionEdit 3: So I got the PC back. So here's how it played out. I got a call later from him asking me to meet him at the store. So me and my cousin go back to his store. So we go there. The PC was in perfect shape. He had already changed the MOBO with the one we had agreed upon. That's how he was able to boot up the PC. The MOBO is a bit of a downgrade from what I originally had but I'm going to college soon and the computer is just going to be used by my parents so it should be fine.He even replaced the PSU. Now coming to the parts.I made it clear to him that I wanted the parts back. I would try to fix the MOBO since it is of a good quality and was fairly expensive. He tried to argue but I didn't agree.I figured that his request might be genuine and promised that if I couldn't fix it I would give it to him. Some of you guys told me that fixing a PSU was risky. We tried it on a PC in his store and it did not work. So I let him keep it. I did check the ram and the Graphics card and other small parts and everything seemed to be perfect. My cousin checked it through windows and he said that every thing was fine.I don't know whether he reinstalled windows and recovered the files. Everything seemed to be the way it was before. There's no way I can confirm it. But many of you guys suggested that when we change a motherboard it does happens so I believe him. The cost to recover the files and reinstall windows was not much. He even bought some screws which were missing from the cabinet. Some USB 3.0 slots had stopped working. He fixed them. The pricing seems fair. He explained everything to me.I think the issue was with the MOBO . We had tried a different PSU in his store and it was the same result as before.pc would turn on for a minute or so and then shut down.The PC is running fine now.Some of you told me that I might have been overreacting a bit. I guess I was. This was a first experience for me. My dad had got this PC built a couple of years ago for my birthday and it really is a special thing to me.                 Some of you also told me that I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions and threatened him.I did apologize to him. It seemed that someone in his family has a problem and I totally get that. However in the heat of the movement I started seeing him as a villian and anything he did seemed sus to me.Many of you guys DMed to offering to help and look at things. However I do not live in the US.I am thankful to all of your guys. You did try to help me out even though you didn't have to. Thank you for that.Lastly I'd like to thank everyone here. You guys have been so helpful. It is so wonderful that such a huge community is willing to help with even the most naive doubts.I learnt so much here and was able to communicate better with him. Thank you guys who voted this in the initial stages. It would have gone unnoticed otherwise.I am going to try to fix my original MOBO. He claimed that it was at fault. I am going to get a second opinion on that.Thank you all one again. If you feel something is wrong do dm me or comment down below ."

"Update: [He loves it!](https://imgur.com/a/r6xhnPr) So my buddy from high school is coming to see me today. We have not seen each other since 2005. I joined the Army and ended up settling in Texas. He moved away too and went to Michigan. We speak almost every day and play games on Xbox. We have never lost contact. Back in 2005 we were avid PC gamers. Counter Strike (pre source) Tribes (god I remember that being such a fun game) Battlefield 1942.... the list just goes on an on. Well he has come up on some tough times. He got divorced 5 years ago and has been living paycheck to paycheck. I got back into PC gaming in 2019 and I told him about the PC I built for my son and the one I built for myself. I could hear in his voice as we reminisced about the good old days and as the conversation went on he realised that he wouldn't be able to obtain one... Well I told myself that I was going to get him a PC together. The Pandemic did not help this at all but I have finally scraped together the parts and the money to give him what I think is a baller system.Asus GT 501 - hand me down from my first build. I didn't realize how big the case was when I originally bought it. I was new to the current generation and this case is big enough for custom water cooling. I switched cases but kept this one for him.Asus B550 Strix WiFi - This is a new part. I didn't have a motherboard I could hand him down. Same with the processor.Ryzen 7 5800x. I'm using a wraith prism for cooling from my Ryzen 7 3700xCorsair Vengeance RGB Pro 32 gb kit 3600 mhz (2x16 gb) the extra RAM in the picture is the lighting kit because he always talks about  RGB goodness and how much he loves it.WD Black M.2 500gb SSDSeagate barracuda 2 TB 7200 RPM driveEVGA RTX 2080 Super OC Black - This is another hand me down.

Got it for cheap.Corsair K70 RGB KeyboardCorsair Dark Core RGBI'm going to ship the case to him with the power supply in a seperate box. He is going to take all of the components with him on the plane returning to Michigan. If the shipping on the case is more than I payed for the case I'm probably just going to buy a different case on newegg and ship it to his house before he leaves. Anyways I can't wait to see how he reacts when he gets to my house! I'm sure he's going to be floored.[https://imgur.com/a/AXtLUuP](https://imgur.com/a/AXtLUuP)"

"https://imgur.com/a/ZSCnfKkSo I always wanted to build a gaming PC but was always too intimidated. What if I bent the pins on the processor die or what if I was missing one tiny cable or tint screw in the M.2 SSD or didn't insert my RAM properly and it didn't load up or boot up or what if I didn't install the motherboard properly and improperly put in the graphics card or dodnt tighten it down firm it enough or broke a pin kn the PCI E x 16 express slot. **And I was struggling the entire time too** my case fucking SUCKED. **Cable management felt impossible and all my cables are a mess and I was overwhelmed by it** **I couldn't install the I/O shield into the case**. *It wouldn't allow me fit both the IO shield and motherboard it couldn't fucking allow me to align the mobo on top of the stand off screw when I/O shield was in the case*. *I felt it was impossible routing the cables from the power supply* and *I was  also really overwhelmed with the front panel connectors because there was almost 0 visibility for light and I couldn't see shit*. Also I was *concerned sure everything was plugged into the power* (because the first time I turned it on **I fucking forgot to connect the PCI E connector from the power supply into the GPU** and freaked out and saw nothing).*And I actually fucking broke something...* one of those **tiny gold Nippon audio capacitors fucking broke off while I ripped the GPU out of the motherboard/case because I didnt install it into the PCI express slot properly.**But I did it and it is built.

"My 13-year-old son's been wanting a gaming PC for over a year now. We've bought him reasonable-quality peripherals for prior birthdays and Christmases to use with his school-issued laptop but the cost of the actual PC isn't in our present budget so for the last few months of 2020 he took a part-time job to save up to buy the components for a PC. With help from us and grandparents he had enough money to start buying components in November.        Following a post to r/BuildMeAPC [here](https://redd.it/k2ly06) we selected [these parts](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/rZHnGq) for our build. The parts all arrived in time for Christmas thankfully so we started our build on boxing day. With a minor [pause](https://redd.it/kkf3hp) and call for help to r/BuildAPC to figure out how to mount the HDD the build is now complete!        The pictures from our assembly journey are [here](https://imgur.com/a/WI0hrql).        Thanks very much to the communities at r/BuildMeAPC and r/BuildAPC for giving us the inspiration and confidence to build the machine ourselves and the guidance to specify and assemble the machine that works as well as ours does first time! We thoroughly enjoyed building the computer ourselves - you've given us a great memory together. Thank you!"

"So I had been replacing my thermal paste and accidentally bent 3 pins as I was putting it back into place without realizing (CPU came out of the socket cause it was stuck to the cooler) . Went to boot and it didnt work. I minorly panicked got my composure and pulled out the CPU again. Noticed 3 of the outer pins were bent. So I took a flathead screwdriver pressed down gently on the top as I slowly wiggled it back into place.When it all looked straight I put it back down pressed it gently into place until it wasnt rocking an inch and then locked it. I mustered up all my courage shit my pants a little pressed the power button and. ... ... IT WORKED!Never have I screamed with such joy before. UEFI recognized it as a new CPU so I had to configure it again but it booted to Windows and I am so happy.Have you had any success stories lately? Ever bent a pin(s) into place?"

"**This guide is now outdated. I will release a new one in the summer of 2017.**Whenever I build or imagine a new PC I can never decide on the right budget. I tend to continuously add incremental upgrades until the system is too powerful for what I need and then I do the reverse. It's hard to settle on a budget. I had some free time recently and I decided to exploit my indecisiveness and suggest 19 PC builds for you at $100 budget increments from $200 to $2000.It's clearly impossible to suggest a one-size-fits all build. I was aiming for what I believed the average consumer would want at each price point. I optimized the builds for a healthy mix of productivity and graphics performance not aesthetics storage or features.It's important to note that the price points are approximate. It's difficult to optimize and progress the builds properly while adhering to the budgets strictly. Therefore some overshoot to accomodate a significant jump (e.g. a more powerful graphics card) while others are not much different than what precedes them. In addition prices and rebates vary significantly over time. Therefore to be safe assume that any build may fall within the range of its price point and the next.I've made a number of changes since my initial post based on community feedback (thank you so much everyone); new hardware (e.g. the GTX 1050 Ti and the Samsung 960 Pro); and my own thinking. Therefore some of the discussion and comments below won't be relevant to the most updated version of the list.I plan on posting a brand new list when Kaby Lake launches. Alternatively I could keep updating this list periodically. Please let me know which you'd prefer.Thanks again everyone for your input discussion and criticism!**Without any further ado here are the builds:**$200* CPU: Intel Pentium G4400 3.3GHz Dual-Core

"Is there any truth to this?"
"My wife and I have a strong history of not being able to wait until Christmas to give each other the presents we got them.Well my wife is about to graduate from nursing school and wants an Apple Watch to wear around during her nursing shifts and various other nurse reasons.Just yesterday her Apple Watch came in from UPS and I couldn’t help but to open the package in the other room and place it in plain sight to see if she would notice it she didn’t so I had to provoke her to finally see it. Need less to say she was speechless because I am usually a penny pinching cheap skate.Later on that night she was alluding to buying me some sort of computer Christmas present and I was curious of what she may think of getting my setup since I know she does not know much about the computer world.She told me she was wanting to get me a GRAPHICS CARD particularly then nvidia 30series.I was so excited but sad at the same time because she didn’t know how scarce they were lol.Just thought I’d share."
"Well it's safe to say that I didn't expect such a large reaction to my last post. RIP my inbox indeed. Thanks everyone for sharing your routines and PC uptime preferences!There were a lot of opinions on what was best and lots of differing opinions on the safety of leaving PCs on constantly vs. shutting down regularly.I decided it would be fun and informative to send a few emails to some bit component manufacturers and see what they thought. It's a big of a mixed bag but TL;DR there isn't a consensus though most say it's better for your components to shut down for the night or when you aren't going to be using your PC for a few hours.Here are the responses I got:**EVGA**>Other than fans and mechanical drives either way will not have an appreciable impact on the lifespan of the components during an average upgrade cycle. The fans and hard drives may ware out faster if left on 24/7 however unless it is a dusty environment the fans may outlast the system. Please note that sometimes windows and power supplies may become unstable after very long periods of up-time so it is best to turn off the system from time to time.Regards EVGA**ADATA**>Dear customer Thanks for supporting ADATA product. It won't impact the normal use.Best Regards ADATA Technology**MSI**>Thanks for contacting MSI technical support.Regarding your concern if you don't need to use it for weeks/months you can shut down it when you don't use it. Thanks!Thanks for your cooperation in advance!Best RegardsMSI Technical Support Team**Samsung (1)**>Thank you for contacting Samsung. With reference to your email I understand that you'd like to know if shutting down your PC every night would wear out the components faster when compared to the PC left ON for weeks. I'll be glad in helping you with the required information.If you use your computer multiple times per day it’s best to leave it on. If you use it for a short time - say an hour or two - just once a day or even less then turn it off during nights and you can turn it on during the mornings or next use.Hope the above provided information would be helpful.Kind regardsAravind B Email Support SAMSUNG Customer Support Center**Samsung (2)**>Thank you for contacting Samsung Support regarding your concerns and inquiries. We apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing you. powering off the system would help the drive last longer overall.Thank you for contacting Samsung and have a good day! IE**Seagate**>Thank you for contacting Seagate Support. I understand that you would like to know if shutting down your computer daily causes more wear. I apologize that this information is not more readily available to you. I will be happy to assist you.Shutting down a computer does not cause more wear on a drive. If this inquiry concerns an internal drive in the computer it will most likely help the drive last longer as internal drives are typically certified to work so many 'power on' hours. These are typically based on the general five days a week eight hours a day.RegardsHeather Seagate Support**Nvidia**>Thank you for contacting NVIDIA Customer care.My name is Imran and I will be assisting you in the query that you have.From the email description I understand that you want to check regarding the shutting down of the system.Please be assured that I will do my best to help you further or point you in the right direction.Shutting down the system would not affect the system components. It is always advisable to shut down the system when not in use as this would increase the life of the systemBest regardsImran NVIDIA Customer Care**Crucial**>Thanks for your email. I am afraid this isn't something that we can answer and being honest there are pro's and con's for each scenario. It has also not been scientifically proven either way.If you have a look around through the link below you will be able to see what others advise for this scenario:https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=will+closing+my+PC+every+night+wear+out+the+PC%3F&oq=will+closing+my+PC+every+night+wear+out+the+PC%3F&aqs=chrome..69i57.10215j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8**ASUS**>Thank you for contacting Asus my name is Paul and I will try my best to assist you with your situation.Unfortunately you have not mentioned what ASUS product this is about. However generally speaking it's best to simply turn off the computer when you are not using it.There was quite a lot of data in the comments of the last post and I was thinking of collecting it and maybe making a spreadsheet/graph out of it. If enough people want to see it collated I'll do it. Well there you have it. A special mention to the EVGA customer support rep who responded within five minutes of my question and who I feel gave a very thoughtful and complete answer.I especially enjoyed the link in the Crucial email that was basically L M G T F Y. Made me laugh :)Edit: One more reply from **Gigabyte**>Hello>Sorry but we do not have a definite answer for this question. >These links are for your reference. >https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000390.htm>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-computers-sleep/Edit 2: Thank you for the gold stranger. Not sure I derseve it but thank you. :DEdit 3: Another response from **Western Digital**>Thank you for contacting Western Digital Customer Service and Support. My name is Marco. I understand from your email that you would like to know which process will wear out the disk faster to improve lifespan.It may be better actually if you turn off you PC whenever you are not using so the disk is not spinning and is not being used. This will avoid long time uses and also local electrical instabilities that may affect your data.If you have any further questions please reply to this email and we will be happy to assist you further.

"If you are in the process of putting together your dream build or you've already built it and want everything to work as it should performance-wise then you're in the right place. Much of the content below is common knowledge for some people but for those who are building for the first time or have been out of the cycle for a while I believe having a compiled list of quality-of-life tips is very helpful; and why are we here as a community other than to help each-other?The following list will cover both hardware and software aspects in a hopefully relevant order. Here we go.*****### **Important Category*******1. **Checking if you are getting the advertised performance out of your new build; the easy way for everyone: UserBenchmark*** Many people will dismiss this tool because of its way of ranking together all the stock and overclocked components. In reality UserBenchmark is really a great way to *start* diagnosing if something's not working right.* When running this tool make sure that your system is as idle as possible (close background apps) to reduce margins of errors (bad results for CPU/storage/etc).* To download and run the tool go to [https://www.userbenchmark.com/](https://www.userbenchmark.com/)* Once the testing is done (usually takes 1-2 minutes max) you'll be taken to a webpage where you can see a report of each of your components. If there are any blatant performance issues with your PC you should be able to identify them by looking at the report.* Don't be bummed out if your component says "performs below expectations". In many cases that is reported because you're running stock components (CPU/GPU/RAM) versus an average on the website that may be overclocked.* After identifying potential issues its time to dedicate some time and start tweaking your machine to your liking.*****2. **Having the memory running at rated speeds. Or above.*** I've seen many cases of builders that assume their RAM will run fine as it is. In reality lets take DDR4 RAM for example; its base speed is 2133MHz and everything above that is technically an overclock. Don't make the mistake of getting superior RAM (like 3000MHz) and letting it run at inferior speeds; go into your BIOS and set XMP in your memory profiles. It usually takes 1 minute and 2 clicks to save you from sluggish performance and getting your money's worth of performance out of your RAM modules.*****3. **Making sure your RAM sticks run in Dual Channel.*** If you have more than 2 sticks mainstream motherboard from both Intel and AMD allow you to run them in "Dual Channel" where not only you'll have the full capacity of the sticks but also double the bandwidth. This helps a lot tasks such as gaming (especially low 1% & 0.1% FPS) and latency-sensitive workloads. UserBenchmark and CPU-z can instantly tell you if your sticks do run in Dual Channel.* Most boards' RAM channels are A1 A2 B1 B2 in this order and their manufacturer's manual recommend putting one RAM stick in A2 and the other in B2 **but this might differ for your motherboard** so I highly suggest reading the manual section on Dual Channel memory when slotting the RAM modules. Dual Channel performance is free and it shouldn't be neglected.*****4. **Keeping your motherboard updated.*** Motherboard updates come with a variety of microcode tweaks and optimizations that boost the mobo's capability of regulating voltage supporting memory and enhancing overclocking potential. Motherboards should be kept up to date but not necessarily every time a BIOS update appears. A good recommendation would be to read the changelog from the manufacturer's website to see what's changed and try to avoid Beta BIOSes. Don't break it if it works and while you have the necessary features.* When a socket is new and not yet optimized its recommended that you keep getting the updates as religiously as possible because the few months after a CPU architecture release will be the most fruitful when it comes to microcode optimizations. Ryzen is a good example here.* **Important.** Don't be discouraged when doing a BIOS update; they are much easier and safer to do than they were in the past. There's an abundant amount of failproof measures that make sure you can't brick your motherboard even if you're doing something stupid. These range from BIOS filechecking before updating and rollbacking to USB Flashback and Dual-BIOS features.* The most common BIOS update way is to get your BIOS file from the manufacturer's website and copy it to a FAT32-formatted USB drive before going into the BIOS and doing the actual flashing.*****5. **Keeping your OS updated.*** I get it. Many of you included myself hate when Windows starts doing its thing and interferes with your session but OS Updates are really the best way of ensuring the best security and performance of your system. For example the Windows scheduler has been greatly upgraded to benefit multicore systems much better than before.* Schedule your Windows updates at night or when you're off to work and they'll never bother you while making your system a better place. An alternative is to read changelogs and update manually when you feel like its needed. Windows Update can be disabled by pressing *Ctrl + R* and typing *services.msc*; you can use this to disable the "Windows Update" service down in the list.*****6. **Undervolting/overclocking/tweaking the CPU.*** Certain CPUs have the ability to overclock their cores (eg. Intel K cpus Ryzen*) because its simply free performance that's otherwise left on the table. I am not going to go into details here because there are lots of overclocking resources out there that you can read to make this process a breeze.* I've put a star next to the Ryzen because there's something important to note here. Ryzen 2000 and 3000 CPUs benefit from a feature called PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive). ELI5: This feature allows the CPU to have a dynamic multiplier which does more than just boost a few cores to advertised speeds. It takes your motherboard's VRM capacity and your cooler's thermal capabilities and smartly adjusts the clockspeeds and voltages to provide the maximum performance needed in your workload (be it gaming/rendering/idle browsing); It essentially works very similar to Nvidia's GPU Boost 3.0 but for CPUs.* Having this feature is a lifesaver for people who are not so knowledgeable with overclocking because it guarantees that your CPU has the best possible computing ant thermal performance out of the box. It almost eliminates the need to all-core overclock (or using P-states) and like some people claim including myself the fun in tweaking your CPU. The feature is clearly a highlight of the Ryzen CPUs.* **Overlooked tip.** Ryzen 3000 series BIOSes let you tweak the Infinity Fabric speed of the CPU. Being decoupled from memory speed (unlike it was in previous generations) it can be tweaked to your liking for more performance ( [LINK](https://youtu.be/vJQKjyBiX_I?t=679) ).* Fan curves will be addressed later.*****7. **Undervolting/overclocking the GPU.*** Similar to how you can get free performance out of the CPU the GPUs can also be overclocked for increased graphical power/framerates. Guides are everywhere as well.* I will specify though that in many cases GPUs come overvolted from the factory and even though it sounds weird many GPUs benefit a lot from decreasing their voltage and then overclocking them. This is because GPUs hold their clockspeeds in relation to thermals and having a lower voltage definitely helps here.* I would love to go in detail for this section but I want to remain concise with this post. Rambling is for discussion.* Similar as in the CPU section fan curves will be addressed later.*****8. **Setting Power Plans in Windows.*** You can go into detail and make a custom power plan for your needs but sometimes its sufficient to set High Performance inside your Power Plan settings to enjoy a boost in performance.* The benefits occur due to you telling Windows how to manage resources inside your systems; good examples are CPU boosting states and how your PC understands if your PC is idle or in need of a burst in performance.* On Ryzen systems you will likely benefit more from setting the "Ryzen Balanced" powerplan.*****9. **Setting the right refresh rate of your monitor.*** There are many (horror) stories out there with builders getting a really nice high-refreshrate monitor (eg. 100/120/144/165/240/etc) forgetting to adjust the Display settings and essentially not noticing any gain in smoothness because the monitor still runs at a default 60Hz. Some have been sitting on that for well over one year not realizing there's something wrong.* To make sure you're running your monitor as its been supposed to go to *Desktop* > *Right-Click* > scroll down & *Advanced display settings* > *Display adapter properties* > *Monitor tab* > Set a global system refresh rate there.* Another additional point here related to the monitor is to make sure you're using the right cable and the right port to connect your monitor. If you have a dedicated GPU connect your monitor to it. If you want to use the CPU's iGPU (if it does have one) plug your monitor in your motherboard. Please note that some systems will need to enable the iGPU option inside the BIOS before it will work. A decent starting point for choosing the best cables for your monitor is this [article](https://www.pcgamer.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-which-display-cable-should-i-use-for-my-monitor/) but the majority of the monitors will come with an included cable that's suitable for the monitor's specs.*****10. **Keeping your GPU drivers updated.*** I believe this needs no introduction. Rendering performance consists of how well the GPU hardware communicates with your system and this happens through software. * Keeping drivers up to date is an easy way of having access to the latest features/optimizations and it can also resolve a lot of bugs and issues. This should be higher in the list based on importance buy I feel like the upper items are more frequently neglected than this one.*****### **Do-it-if-you-want-to Category*******11. **Testing your components right before building a PC.*** This is not usually stressed enough. It doesn't usually happen but one can be unlucky enough to get a part that is factory broken; a DoA part. * Testing a motherboard debug's response by connecting the 24pin ATX cable and shorting the power pins may save you many painful hours of having to take apart a build that you put hard work in.*****12. **Cable managing.*** I can't stress enough how this impacts your build both in the short run and the long run.* A messy case interior will be bad for case airflow component updates cleaning overall looks and the list can go on. Bad cable managing can be harmful for the components (eg. loose cable interfering with a fanblade).* A tidy case that is logical to understand will be a pleasure to work on during the life of the build. So take 30 minutes to make sure cables are where they're supposed to be (cases nowadays have an abundance of options for cable management). Once you do this several times you'll get better at it and do it on the naturally on the run as it will become a common best practice.*****13. **Airflow fan curves and dust filters.*** Well built cases are optimized to cool the interior components by providing a way for the cool air from one side of the case (intake) to go to the other side of the case (outtake) and cooling the internals in this process. This is called airflow ( [LINK](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/xideal.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.dWjRMVYhz_.jpg) ).* Airflow can be adjusted in many ways but a simple rule of thumb is making sure your intake fan(s) capacity matches the outtake fan(s) capacity thus creating an equal case pressure (eg. 2x120mm intake fans 2x120mm outtake fans). * Having more intake capacity will cause a positive pressure inside the case and essentially an ineffective way to provide good air circulation for the exhaust. Having more outtake fans (or in some cases no intake fans at all) will cause a negative pressure inside the case. No cool air coming from outside the case will severely limit the performance of your components and in many cases it can favor dust gathering on your components.* Fan curves are closely tied to cooling and they can be individually set for the case CPU cooler and GPU cooler from the BIOS and softwares like MSI Afterburner. These help optimize your cooling and noises in a graph where fan speed depends on temperature.* Cases with front mesh tend to be better in airflow than cases with a closed front so do research before getting the X case "because its pretty".* Last but not the least dust filters are there for a reason. Nobody wants a dusty case that can electrically damage components or provide sub-par cooling performance. This is why though its recommended that you do a general clean-up of your case once a year you just need to do a dust filter maintenance from time to time. Powering off your machine taking out and cleaning the dust filters is simple and very effective.*****14. **Take control of how your multicore system manages tasks with [ProcessLasso](https://bitsum.com/).*** An extraordinary tool for power users that can set CPU core affinities per app (similar to how Task Manager can but permanent) adjust SMT/HT settings and squeeze performance out of the CPU when its supposed to. Its essentially a tool that helps users who know their workloads well and know how to split the CPU resources to benefit the most out of them.*****### **Nice-to-care-about Category******** Cases with tempered glass panels are fragile. Be careful when handling it or you'll need to cleanup the little glass shards in no time. I surely did regret it on my first tempered glass build.* On most motherboards the top PCIe slot is the best place to connect your GPU. Bandwidth and performance may be hampered if you connect your GPU to the other slots.* If you're using PCIe storage like M2/NVME drives note that at least two SATA ports will be disabled on most motherboards; usually the last two ones. Manuals will tell you about this but its a pain to get your build setup just to notice your storage devices are not recognized fully.* Don't put too much pressure when screwing down the CPU cooler. Most CPU coolers are millimetrically adapted to the socket so that they create a small space between the CPU IHS and the cooler surface for the thermal paste. Screw them down with the force of three fingers or based on manual instructions.* Rather small build detail but present on a lot of case types: If you'll want to cable manage the case and bring the CPU cable to the upper-left port of the motherboard many times this cable's head won't fit through the narrow gap between the motherboard and the case metal. It is recommended that you pull this cable through there before screwing down the motherboard so you avoid having to do this after other components have been mounted.*****### **Nice-to-know tools******** A great and up-to-date system monitoring tool is [HWInfo64](https://www.hwinfo.com/download/)* Get information about the CPU memory and perform brief stress testing with this well supported tool: [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)* The same as CPU-Z but for GPU information [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/) handles every piece of information about your GPU from BIOS and driver versions to clockspeeds and memory manufacturers.* [Macrium Reflect](https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree) is a great tool for cloning disks.

"So as the title states I had a 1080 that was crashing and had insane artifacts basically dead and I baked it back to life.I tore the card down and removed everything I could cleaned up the thermal paste and baked it at 375 for 9-10 minutes.  After letting it cool back down I reassembled it and threw it in my pc to test it. Ladies and gentlemen I’m very happy to announce that the Asus ROG Strix 1080 has been returned to life.  It passed all benchmarks and stress tests no matter how long they were.  Everything is operating exactly like it did when it was new.If you have any dead GPU’s I highly recommend trying this if for nothing else than science.*Edit* BAKING your card will release toxic fumes.  Please research this before you do it.  There are a plethora of knowledgeable comments that will probably answer most questions in this thread.  THIS IS FOR SCIENCE ONLY*Edit 2* Hi!  I’d never imagine there would be so many internet geniuses telling me what I did does work.  That’s awful it doesn’t work for you and some people don’t see it as a “proper” repair method but it’s what I did for science.  No tearing it down and reassembling with new past didn’t help.  I’ve already previously done that at least 8 times.  This is an experiment I conducted in an attempt to revive a 1080.  If you don’t believe it worked just move on nobody cares and please don’t half listen to YouTubers and regurgitate what you think proves your point to me here because You’re objectively wrong.  Thanks guys!Good luck and have fun!"
"***Disclaimer: VERY long post ahead one that almost saturates the 40000-character Reddit limit. I hope to help the younger or more inexperienced system builders out there and anyone confused or stuck at some point. I encourage you younger and inexperienced builders to read through the whole thing and others to skim over at their pace. Also since this is based on my experience over a decade of building AMD rigs and the Ryzen rig I built recently over the past couple of months a lot of examples use AMD systems. Regardless most if not all that advice and experience can be applied to Intel systems and I’ve done my best to do so. Happy reading!***Greetings fellow RedditorsI’m writing here today to share with those of you eyeing that shiny new build some advice on that topic. This will be from experience I have gained over the years and indeed gained over the past few months that were spent obsessing over the Ryzen build I’ve just finished piecing together.A little background on myself is in order: I’ve been a pc enthusiast for slightly over a decade now and have recently earned a Master’s degree in the field of Computer Science. You most certainly do not need any qualification of that nature to be doing this simply because no engineering or science degree in the field will teach you this stuff. PC building ultimately relies on its community of enthusiasts and DIYers to continue enriching the shared knowledge pool for all of us out there. Indeed I started building back in the 9th grade and am happy to say I haven’t blown anything yet and the local power station still exists. So without much ado here’s the system I’ve just built:Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 OC’ed to 3.7GHz @ 1.275vMotherboard: Gigabyte GA-AB350 Gaming 3Graphics Card: Gigabyte AORUS GTX 1080 Ti 11GBRAM: 16GB (8x2) Corsair Vengeance LPX 3000 @ 2933MHz CL16 (XMP)PSU: Corsair RM750xSamsung 850 EVO 250 GB (Primary OS & Applications)Crucial MX300 275GB (Game Drive)Western Digital 1TB mass storage hard driveLG 34UM60 2560x1080 75Hz Freesync display (Soon to be replaced by an Acer Z35 G-Sync display)All this in a NZXT S340 Elite caseYes that’s a good high-end build beyond which point the effect of diminishing performance returns looms really large currently. Many of you reading this will be quick to point out the smaller game drive SSD (and you’d be right there) and will definitely point out that a 2560x1080 panel is not enough for this build and why pixel density for that resolution at 34” is poor. Allow me an opportunity to counter that in the section dedicated to monitors in this post. Maybe also the B350 chipset instead of an X370. Let’s break it all down component by component:**Considerations in choosing a processor:**Risking backlash I’m going to say this flat out: buy the fastest factory-clocked chip you can buy without telling yourself you’ll overclock it to match the faster chips. This is in stark contrast to the overclocked Ryzen 1700 I’ve put into my own build. Here’s why:1.	You’re going to tell yourself you’re saving money on the chip and being very smart but will spend that money on a X370 board “for the beefier VRMs and overclocking features” and will then convince yourself you need a 280mm radiator because who buys a 140mm one right?2.	Companies like AMD and their motherboard manufactures like to make overclocking sound very easy they make many videos of it and when you see experts from these companies reiterate how easy and quick it is you tend to believe it. It’s not that simple and requires more work.The companies will make it look easy because the chipset designer like AMD wants to sell you the X370 chipset for a multitude of reasons: one they may have higher margins on those than on processors themselves and two because once they’ve got you to invest in a top of the line board they’ve effectively sold you onto their platform and made you reluctant to move away. Along with making you very unlikely to shift away from their ecosystem they also might have sold you few more future processors supported by the socket and motherboard! Motherboard manufacturers like it because come on it’s obvious: the boards cost more.While we’ll talk about the motherboards next focusing on the processors for now overclocking them can be expensive. Let’s consider the cost: a Ryzen 1800x is $500 (can be found at $429 easily now days) and a Ryzen 1700 is $330 (can be found around $270 I believe). That’s less than a $200 price difference. An X370 board will often cost a $100 over the B350 board I picked up and the water coolers range from $110-$160. You’ve most probably spent more already if not as much. Yes you can overclock with a B350 + an air cooler but most of you will not do that. You’ll see the videos read the reviews and say “Oh I want to stick with Ryzen for long I’ll just get the ‘better’ board with the overclocking features.” Factor in a better air cooler for even $50 and the cost difference between a R1700 and a R1800x vanish. The difference is even smaller with the R1600 and R1600x. Yes you’ll also need to buy a cooler with the “x” marked chips even then you’re not saving a significant amount if you’re saving any at all that is. As for overclocking itself keep in mind you need to fidget a lot with voltages and every time you think you’ve found a stable voltage you need to stress test it for many many hours before being sure. Some enthusiasts will say 24hrs some will say 48 some will say “hey if doesn’t crash on a Prime95 SmallFFT or Blend test in an hour you’re gold because gaming won’t stress it as much anyway” and they’re right with that. What do I say? Given that a machine can fail a stress test at even the 30th hour and be deemed “unstable” do it for as long as you’re patient. If you’re okay with keeping the rig on all night only to wake up and see it crashed and its experiment time again go ahead. I don’t have that patience I need something that just works good and fast. Most of you do too. Another point to this story: voltage requirements change over an extended period of time as the CPU mildly degrades from an overclock that’s not been thoroughly tested. Case in point: I had my R1700 pass a couple hours of the Prime95 SmallFFT CPU torture test when clocked to 3.65GHz @1.18v. Fast forward a couple months when I started noticing mildly weird behavior from my system and it bluescreened in 2 minutes of that test. Now it’s at 3.7GHz @ 1.275v having passed several hours of SmallFFT again. Will it degrade again? Who knows. How can I ensure against it? Thorough stability testing. What comprises that? Who knows you’ll get many different accounts. Get the fastest factory-clocked chip. Look at overclocking as something you’d do to extend the life of the CPU for a couple extra months or maybe a year before replacing it. The 1800x and 1600x overclock to 4.0GHz on 2 cores and 4.1GHz on one that’s already great for most games out there that are single thread heavy (like GTA V and Far Cry 4). The couple extra frames you might get from future games is simply not worth it especially if you manage a Freesync or G-sync display on your rig.This advice applies just as well to Intel chips. Get the fastest factory clocked chip but with Intel also do try to get the ‘K’ or ‘X’ marked chips for the unlocked multiplier. Why? Because Intel upgrades are always costlier since you most likely need to change your motherboard as well. So a chip capable of some overclocking might really extend the life of your rig just ask the i5 2500k owners!**Considerations in choosing a motherboard:**Now this is my favorite topic and the component I spent the most time researching. Why? Because of how everyone seems to love justifying getting the most expensive board out there. There’s always a good reason: “beefier VRMs dude!” “more I/O dude!” “SLI dude!”. First up I am not suggesting you get a 1800x and shove it onto a $60 A320/B350 board. Nah that’s another extreme. Likely because those boards were not really manufactured with the thought that they’d be graced with a top-of-the-line chip and may actually have weaker VRMs. But look at some of the top B350 boards which are known to officially support an 1800x very well. You’ll have no problems running it maybe even overclocking it a bit. But really consider the future proofing excuse AMD recently stated these first-generation Ryzen chips were “the worst-case scenario” considering the new architecture on a new process node. Future chips will only have higher clocks at lower voltages meaning an adequate VRM such as those on the top B350 boards would do just fine. Also most VRMs on X370 boards are already known to be overkill for current Ryzen chips. Personally I rank the beefier VRM reasoning as the weakest one for an expensive motherboard.Continuing our look at some great B350 boards they have the same awesome ALC1220 audio codec as their X370 counterparts solid build quality BIOS recovery facilities like Dual BIOS and some other goodies like the diagnostic LEDs on the Gigabyte boards and they cost a $100 less than their equivalent X370 boards. Talking of I/O since many fear the lack of adequate SATA and USB ports speaking from my experience my Gaming 3 board comes with 7 USB ports 4 of them are taken up by the keyboard mouse speaker and the USB WiFi dongle. That still leaves me with 3 USB3 ports. On top of this I get two extra USB 3.0 port along with a couple USB2.0 ports for the front from the motherboard and simply use them for any external device I connect. Point being I still have adequate empty slots. The board I have comes with 6 SATA ports. Ryzen itself provides for 2 of these and I believe you lose them should you attach an M.2 SATA drive. Considering the miniscule real-world difference of using even a NVMe drive which we’ll also speak of soon I’d say 6 ports is really overkill for 99% of the PC users out there. Granted my use case and yours would differ but I doubt by very much even with high-end builds.Let’s talk of multiple GPUs. Firstly you should really only be considering this if you’re planning on 4k and more so if you’re futureproofing for any upcoming 4k 144Hz monitor you’re hoping to splurge on as and when they come out. For all other purposes you’re advised to stick to a single powerful GPU by getting the best one you can afford. Why? Consider that SLI has very poor developer support and when it does you’re very very unlikely to see 100% scaling and get 60FPS where you were getting 30FPS. Also considering Nvidia has over 70% of the GPU market share I don’t need to elaborate on the brilliant developer support Crossfire enjoys. You would be much happier and face much less headaches and have much more fun and even save considerable dough with a single 1080 Ti rather than a pair of 1080s in SLI. But supposing you do want the 1080 Ti or even a Titan SLI setup because of the aforementioned 144Hz 4k or because you’re certified Enthusiast Number 1 with a wallet deeper than the Marina Trench you may then want to consider a HEDT platform as Ryzen and most chips around that price will support only a single PCI-E 3 lane running at x16. For example SLI may be supported by Ryzen on X370 boards but the two slots will run on x8/x8 mode. Intel will be similar do check. While this would not have been an issue a couple years ago with the advent of monsters such as the 1080 Ti and Titan cards and the equally monstrous high resolution high refresh rate displays there are noted instances of such a x8/x8 setup for SLI actually bottlenecking such cards. So get a Threadripper and enjoy the 64 PCI-E lanes regardless of chip or get a X299 based processor that supports the desired number of lanes but don’t pick up X370 or similar Intel counterparts for SLI. As for Crossfire if you’re intent on it several B350 boards do support it though again in a x8/x8 setup though that may prove adequate for AMD cards. Point being: get either a single 1080 Ti or if SLI’ing those or Titans look at an HEDT rig and do it properly (and get a 1200W PSU to be absolutely safe).You’ll likely have a similar situation with Intel boards. I’d just like to conclude this section by saying it’s hardly ever necessary to spend nearly $200 on a motherboard when so many in the $90-$130 range are built so well and packed with adequately more than the essential features. Visit the manufacturers websites and take advantage of their comparison tools; do your own homework before you spend the extra amount just because you think you should or because it’s the most popular thing to do.**Considerations for CPU cooling:**Another topic that gets a lot of attention only some of which is justified according to me is CPU cooling. Yes it is important to keep the chip cool but not as cool as possible. Why? Simply because there’s no need to spend the money there. Consider this my R7 1700 at 3.7GHz reached 85 degrees during a Prime95 SmallFFT torture test while using its default 95W Spire cooler. That is indeed high yet 10 degrees lower than the 95 degrees limit AMD prescribes for it but here’s the kicker: it gets that hot in a scenario very unrepresentative of my regular use case. While gaming it doesn’t exceed 65 degrees a full 30 degrees below its 95 degree limit even with the AORUS 1080Ti in my system radiating it’s heat upwards and towards it over prolonged gaming sessions. Yes a better air cooler would knock it down by maybe 10-12 degrees a water cooler by 15-25. But why? The chip is far below it’s 95 degrees limit and I cannot hear the fan. A loud fan is indeed a good reason to get a better cooler if the noise from your fan bothers you by all means go ahead and get one. If however the sound from the fan is not bothering you yet save that money. The sound from the Wraith cooler on my older Phenom II X6 1090T really bothered me and I simply solved it by swapping out that fan for a better one; a much cheaper faster and easier solution rather than changing the whole thing!If you really like the idea of an AIO liquid cooler then go ahead but I urge you to consider a 140mm radiator to save some dough. Yes 280mm is better but a 140mm radiator is already as good or slightly better than most good air coolers and that’s really perfect enough. But more importantly do consider that you’re adding another part to your rig that is candidate for an RMA: the pumps do fail sometimes sooner than later and worse: liquid leaks. Maybe it’s not as common but it still happens: just recently I came across a post here on Reddit by a person whose Corsair H100i literally burst a pipe during operation and fried his motherboard and GTX 970. Also when you are thinking of that sexy Kraken or H100i consider that neither NZXT nor corsair are known for their world class customer service. Just be sure of your decision and think of it from many angles is all I’d like to reiterate. Personally I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night thinking of any CPU water cooling equipment the Kraken or the H100i or whatever lingering right over my 1080 Ti but that’s just me. You may differ.One last thing: you may think you’re keeping your room cool in the summer by gaming with the CPU at just 35 degrees Celsius thanks to your 360mm radiator but keep in mind that heat has got to go somewhere and a better CPU or any component cooler is only considered better for its ability to dump more heat from the component that it is cooling into its surrounding environment. You may be running your chip cooler at the cost of a warmer zone around your PC all for no added benefit to your CPU that’s already well below its thermal limit! **Considerations in choosing a power supply:**This is the one component I advise you to splurge on. Get a great PSU after all it’s going to be delivering power to your components do you really want to skimp on that?! As for wattage you must decide based on your use case. If this is a rig you may even have a remote probability of upgrading in the future get at least a good 650W PSU. That should be enough for a high-end processor and a 1080 Ti along with a good number of HDDs and SSDs. Were possible getting a 700W or 750W PSU would not hurt so as to keep a little extra breathing room though it may not be immediately essential. If you feel you may SLI or Crossfire in the future and have a rig with some watercooling and several drives please do look at a 1200W PSU. If you’re beyond certain of a zero possibility of upgrading and are building a moderate system even a 550W PSU should suffice: but never skimp on quality. If there is any chance that you may upgrade think how much it would suck to have to buy a new PSU again at that time. Invest in this one it’s a long-term call.There are also PSUs with digital interfaces that let you monitor things via software I do not think that’s very useful but if you like the idea get one. One thing: the PSUs by Corsair that have the digital interface have one feature over the standard ones I like: a PSU fan test switch. With many PSUs having a silent operation mode and keeping their fans off when the power draw is below a certain amount (350W on my 750W RMx I believe) the fan stays off and sometimes one gets concerned that the fan is at least operational. A fan test switch is indeed useful here. Corsair has the RMi and HXi series with the ‘i’ demarcating the digital interface. Other PSU brands will have something similar. Check on it.**Considerations for storage:**This one is relatively simpler yet I messed up a bit here. Definitely get a 250GB SSD for the OS. I find this capacity adequate. Remember I also use my system for work and have several IDEs and Dev tools such as Visual Studio with several SDKs and even Unreal Engine installed on my C drive along with Ghost Recon Wildlands Elite Dangerous and Far Cry 4 and I still have 40GB free. Yes I keep all documents music and videos on the mass storage hard drive and not on the C drive and if you aren’t already get with the program and move your files off the C drive ASAP.Where I messed up is the slightly small 275GB game drive SSD. Large games with huge textures benefit immensely from an SSD and having a SSD to shove those games that should be on an SSD is a very worthy investment. It would be ideal for me to have a 1TB SSD for them and have them all in one place this makes Windows reinstalls a lot easier as all the games are on one drive and need minimal setup. Alas that’s out of my budget for now and the 275GB drive is simply a stop gap arrangement. Based on the games that you play and their size get a separate SSD for them as and when you can afford to it makes maintaining them far easier especially when you are in that situation wherein a fresh Windows installation must be done. Use a large HDD for mass storage of documents and older games.As for NVMe? I recently had a chat with a game developer who worked on Far Cry Primal and For Honor back when he was a Game Dev for Ubisoft and he’s currently running a Threadripper 1950X and two EVGA FTW3 1080 Tis in SLI on his private development rig which has no NVMe drives. He said the 0.5 second savings in load times is not worth it to him. Here’s a dude with no shortage of reasons and money for a fast rig of that stature and he didn’t need a NVMe drive. I doubt most of us do either. Save the dough unless you need the space savings or are getting one for very near the price of a regular SSD just get the regular SSD. Spend the money on a better GPU and PSU or go buy a gym membership and a box of whey protein and stop obsessively spending all this time here!**Considerations in choosing RAM:**16GB is regarded as a good amount today more than adequate for today’s stuff and enough legroom for tomorrows awesomeness. If you cannot currently afford that much get 8GB. Most processors run dual channel memory and so for budget builds many will advise a 4GB x 2 configuration. I advise against this. Why? Maybe you can’t get 16GB now but it will be essential soon and maybe you can add a second 8GB stick 6 months later. Keep it as future proof as possible why get around to buying another 2 4GB sticks later and struggle if you encounter issues with this setup? You’ll encounter no initial issues with the single channel setup and in the future when you get a dual channel setup you won’t encounter any issues then either.Do check compatibility well. Ryzen is known to really favor Samsung B-die this has been confirmed by AMD themselves. Other chips may have similar preferences. Google memory support on your platform of choice before pulling the trigger to be sure. I got lucky and my LPX runs on XMP with no issues and even passed a night of MemTest. But don’t rely on chance and so please do a little research on this you’ll save yourself of a colossal headache diagnosing issues that stem from memory that creates all sorts of instabilities and prevents a boot in the worst case.As for RAM speeds please don’t think spending an extra $100 on 3600MHz memory over 3000MHz memory will do you any wonders. Yes you may score higher at benchmarks but in any practical application may actually see as little as a 2%-3% difference that too when you’re lucky!**Considerations in choosing a case:**Go with what you need. Talk to yourself about what exactly are your requirements. I choose the S340 Elite because it’s the best looking compact ATX case and there’s a fair chance I travel around and I would hate to have to check-in this rig on flights. With a case as compact as this I can just take it as carry-on baggage. I spent a ton of time sitting on manufactures websites with a scale in my hand pouring over the dimensions of these cases as mentioned on their specification sheets. See what your requirements are and invest accordingly. Again it would suck to have to buy a new case at a later date and to reassemble.Maybe you hope to move onto Threadripper or X299 in the future. Then you’ll may need a case that can support the Extended ATX (E-ATX) size some of the boards of those platforms require. Assess your requirements thoroughly and invest once and invest well.**Considerations in choosing a graphics card:**Yes finally. I know many of you were waiting on this one. So there’s three ways I’d recommend to go about this: firstly simple: get the fastest card you can currently afford. But what if it’s not that great a card/you desire more? What if you can “only” get a GTX 1080 now but you know a couple months later can get a 1080 Ti? That gets us to my second approach: if you need a working computer right away get the cheapest card you can find. Maybe a reliable secondhand HD 7850 for $50. Maybe a GTX 1050 for $65 or a RX 550 or whatever. And hold it for a few months before getting a top of the line card.But what if you don’t need a 1080Ti now are sure you will not need it in the near future either and can get a 1060 or RX 570 or something and are completely okay with that? Maybe you are certain of sticking to 1080p@60Hz or similar. Then just get the best you can get and be happy. Just make sure you’re really certain. It’s easy to convince yourself that you are content with your parts at the time you’re paying for them but it is far easier to start craving for more once the gaming begins. Don’t let that be you. Be sure of your requirements if you’re keen on jumping onto 144Hz or 1440p or even 1440p 144Hz or 4k but can’t afford a 1080 or 1080Ti now maybe you can plan to spend on that a couple months down the line. It’s better to sacrifice today and get a small cute little 1050 only to make a really nice jump a short bit later. This is also what I did. I bought a reference 4GB RX480 back in March before the mining craze. Got it brand new from Newegg with Doom free and a $30 rebate for a final price of $160. Man those were good times for GPUs…seems a long time back now. I sold that RX 480 slightly after the mining craze and moved on to this GTX 1080 Ti. Why didn’t I sell earlier? I was convinced on RX Vega and so blinded by it I didn’t even consider this move. So there is my final and most important point WRT GPU purchases: never ever make plans on the basis of future releases. Even if the product is good you may not get your hands on it at MSRP for months. If you can wait that out with your current build then by all means do so. Otherwise just get the best deal out there on the move you plan to make and get on with your life. When choosing between various high-end parts just get the best priced one. I picked the AORUS 1080 Ti because it was the cheapest of all custom 1080 Tis at the time I also knew it’s copper baseplate cooling was superior to many others but I didn’t really bother verifying this. Price ruled. What difference are you expecting between an AORUS 1080Ti and a MSI Gaming X or an ASUS Strix? They’re aftermarket cards from good brands and are definitely better than the Founders Edition that’s really all that matters. If the Strix was cheaper I’d have got that even though I liked the AORUS card’s look more. Doesn’t matter. These cards are also incredibly fast and overclocking them really won’t be worth your time and thought. Just stick with a good brand with good after sales support and get the cheapest amongst them without worry. Really think 20MHz or even 50MHz on a 1080 Ti will matter? Nvidia boost automatically takes my card up to 1984MHz though Gigabyte claims just 1600MHz something on their website. All other cards will be the same ditto for other chips. As long as you’re getting one with a good AIB custom cooler just get the best priced model and move on.**Considerations when choosing a monitor:**Now this is a touchy topic. You may be confused with all the terminology out there I was too. First thing first for a gaming setup I absolutely recommend a Freesync or a G-Sync panel depending on your graphics card being an AMD or a Nvidia card. Either ways I absolutely recommend active refresh and not for the screen tearing which didn’t personally bother me as much though again you may be different but instead for the removal of stutter from those times your framerate falls below the refresh rate of the monitor and for extending the life of your rig by providing a smooth gaming experience for a longer time. Let me share my own experience:I initially had a RX 480 in my system with a 1080p 60Hz monitor. With a good mix of high and very-high settings coupled with anti-aliasing it rarely ever kept to a smooth 60 FPS. I hated the stutter and soon switched to my current ultrawide 75Hz monitor. Aware of the increase in resolution I was certain I’d have to slash settings down even further on my system but thanks to Freesync I never ended up having to care. I did not reduce my quality settings in a single game GTA V or Witcher 3 or Elite Dangerous as framerates down to low 50s felt butter smooth. Following the Vega fiasco I ended up with a 1080 Ti. Now this card is amazing no doubt at all. Where the RX 480 could not even run GTA V at a smooth 60 FPS with no MSAA and high settings I get a smooth 75FPS with 4xMSAA and every setting maxed other than grass and the advanced stuff. I get the 140FPS I should in the GTA V benchmark and 95FPS on the Ghost Recon benchmark with Very High settings. But let me tell you something there are still times when the framerate drops. Not very frequently but not so infrequently that I can just dismiss it. Sometimes you’ll end up in that fucked up scenario in GTA V where you’re downtown and it is nighttime and there’s tons of reflection and shadow and a lot of cars and people and it rains and there’s fog and my framerate actually tanks to 50-55 FPS. In Ghost Recon keeping Turf Effects on along with ultra shadows and vegetation leads to a smooth 60 FPS and yet a good number of times it will drop to 45-50. The stutter sucks. I hate it. Enough to have scouted out a G-Sync ultrawide somehow. Look the benchmarks you see in card reviews are great and I too get those figures and the 100 FPS on Witcher 3 at ultra with 4x Hairworks and the 28000 points on Fire Strike but real-life gaming is not represented well by these benchmarks. There will be moments that bring even really powerful systems down and the bigger problem: not all games are optimized well. Case in point Far Cry 4 hates Ryzen in my experience and Firewatch and Euro Truck Sim 2 aren’t the best optimized games either. No matter how fast your processor with how many cores and how expensive your GPU not every game will run at those incredible framerates at least not all the time and not even the ones that benchmark really well. Active refresh technologies like G-Sync and Freesync are a very essential part of a gaming rig in my humble opinion.Now you may have heard of LFC or Low Framerate Compensation on monitors. Yes this is another worthy feature. What does it do? Briefly put if there are times your framerate falls really low below the minimum boundary of the Freesync or G-Sync range it’ll automatically display each frame twice so as effectively double the framerate and thus push it back into the Free/G sync range. So 20 FPS moments turn to 40 FPS. Again a great feature to have. While only some Freesync panels have this all G-Sync panels do. Keep in mind the new Freesync 2 certification from AMD requires all Freesync 2 panels to have this feature. G-Sync panels also have a feature called Ultra Low Motion Blur or ULMB which aims to combat the excessive blurring you may encounter when the framerates and refresh rates are so high that the monitors response time slows down to several milliseconds. Again briefly put it aims to strobe the backlight in sync with the refresh rate but here’s the caveat: G-Sync must be off for it to take effect and its generally effective at the 85+ FPS range. As G-Sync is often a better feature to have enabled don’t overpay for a monitor that claims to have a superior implementation of ULMB.Now for the very touchy topic of pixel density or more so the lack of it. Many will claim they absolutely need ‘x’ dpi but really most of us will not notice. I’ve gamed on PS4’s hooked to 1080p 50” displays that looked fantastic and using a 2560x1080 34” ultrawide has been a gorgeous experience. Yes the extra screen space obtained for productivity from a 3440x1440 panel may be nicer but you know what’s better? Not having extra space in my wallet due the $400-$600 extra I didn’t spend on the low refresh rate 1440p ultrawide panel. I was almost sold on them and was reading reviews for the Acer X34 when on the conclusion page despite awarding it the “Editor Recommended” batch Tom’s hardware felt compelled to mention how you shouldn’t dismiss the Z35 just for its lower resolution as its brilliant panel makes this a non-issue. Heading over to the conclusion page for the Z35 review they call it “the most beautiful display that has graced our labs”. Now I doubt Acer would pay to show the Z35 over the X34 so I believe they’re being honest and if they can feel that after testing all those displays you should reconsider your worry on “pixel density”. Nonetheless I did manage to check them both out in person and was really glad Tom’s said that as they were absolutely right: I found no reason to pay that much extra from the X34 1440p display. I program work and game on a 2560x1080 display and am only thrilled each time. Don’t believe people on the internet who profess their necessity for high pixel densities and thank God for having spent on it: it’s the internet there’s a very good chance they’re either just trying to get themselves to feel better for having spent that extra amount or are image/video professionals who for some reason feel the need to state why they need it when it’s obvious to us all that they do. Some will be nice and honest too. 34 inches is not “too much” for 2560x1080 but those many extra hundreds of dollars might be too much for you. Don’t let this deprive you of the experience an ultrawide monitor can get you and do think twice and try to check them out in person always.Also an added bonus many 2560x1080 panels including the Z35 have a very high refresh rate along the lines of 165-200 Hz. So the 1080 Ti might be rendering to a slightly lower resolution screen but really gets to stretch its legs with that refresh range on a G-Sync panel. Also the 1080 Ti in my system just got more future proof thanks to this. See why I say don’t dismiss things easy?!Lastly would I recommend an ultrawide display? Absolutely. Again a game changing and exhilarating experience not only the first time you play but each time. And full screen modern movies. What’s not to love?**All this finally leads us to our conclusions:****Conclusions:**1.	Buy the fasted factory-clocked chip you can overclock only when necessary or if you have the time and patience to learn to do it right. You can also spend on a CPU in stages say if you’re building a system today on a limited budget and hope to upgrade in the future get a good motherboard and PSU and a Ryzen 1400 or 1500X. That’s adequate for now and then around 18 months later when 2nd gen Ryzen is out get the top notch 6 or 8 core model then. With intel your choices in this regard may be limited as they always have so many motherboard sockets. Maybe you can get an i3/i5 now and get an i7 from the same generation later on from the secondhand market.2.	With motherboards more expensive is hardly ever necessary. Look for a solid board in the $90-$130 range it’ll probably have more than enough I/O connectivity and PCI-E lanes for you. Then again if going the X299 or X399 route go all out and get the beefiest fanciest board you can: you’re not upgrading for ages and no point getting onto the HEDT bandwagon and compromising even a single feature thanks to the board. And surely going this route you can afford it!3.	Check RAM compatibility on your platform. For a gaming system if not going with 16GB today get a single 8GB stick and upgrade by adding another one later so as to get them on dual channel mode. Don’t think you’re going to get a world of difference by splurging on 3600MHz memory over 2600MHz one. The real-world performance difference is negligible if you’re lucky you may see a couple extra frames. Also do keep in mind that with Ryzen any RAM speed above 3200MHz depends on silicon lottery as RAM speeds directly correlate to the speed of the Infinity Fabric in the chip. You may splurge to get the highest speed RAM kit but may have no luck running it!4.	Splurge on a solid PSU. If you’re definitely not upgrading just get what you need for your current build and be done with it. Otherwise get as much breathing space as possible. If you may go with SLI/Crossfire in the future and may have watercooling pumps and radiators and several drives get at least a 1200W PSU.5.	A 250GB SSD for the OS and applications should be more than adequate. Try to get a separate SSD for the games it is definitely worth it for the newer larger titles and be sure to add a mass storage hard drive.6.	Get a case that suits your needs. If you’ll be travelling get a compact one. If you’ll be upgrading to an E-ATX based platform like Threadripper or X299 get a case that’ll accommodate them when it’s time.7.	Don’t get talked into the pixel density argument WRT monitors. Try them out yourself but don’t over splurge beyond your means. Definitely try your best to score Free/G sync and do consider ultrawide displays. A 29-inch ultrawide is as tall as a 24” 16:9 monitor and a 34” one is as tall as a 27” 16:9 display. Keep that in mind when choosing and try to get a large one especially if you’re paying extra for G-Sync as you may not upgrade soon.8.	Don’t obsess with running your CPU as cool as possible it’s unnecessary as long as it’s running well within thermal range and keep in mind that all that excess CPU cooling will just dump more heat into the surrounding thus creating a warmer atmosphere for you around your PC for no added benefit to the chip. Think also of the higher risk of pump failure and liquid leakage and the RMA hassles before you invest in watercooling. With custom cooling loops think of the fuss each time you need to move anything inside what with draining the reservoir and everything do your research beforehand and be sure you’re ready for all this.9.	Lastly along with Googling your doubts and asking them here and on other forums spend time on the manufactures websites. They often have great comparison tools and detailed specs. Make use of that and of your own reasoning don’t blinded accept anything you’re told without researching this way yourself and putting your own thought into it.**Some general things to keep in mind when building:**1.	If your PSU has those daisy-chain 8 pin connectors for the GPU in a (6+2) + (6+2) config for high powered cards that have two 8-pin power slots use two different cables instead of daisy chaining. Remember the following:6 pin = 75 watts6+2 = 8 pin = 150 wattsSo using:8 pin is okay6+2 is okay6+6 to a single 8 pin is okayBut8+8 in one cable via daisy chaining is not6+2 + 6+2 in one cable via daisy chaining is not and6+2 + 6 via daisy chaining is not2.	Be sure to plug in RAM in the right slots. In my motherboard the RAM acted very funny and never enabled XMP when I’d accidently left them in the black slots numbered 2 and 4. I moved them to the red slots numbered 1 and 3 and all has been good since. Your board may have such a need too. Check the manual.3.	Run MemTest once overnight on newly installed RAM with XMP enabled.4.	Don’t forget to enable XMP in the BIOS! This has to be done manually!5.	Update the BIOS only when needed when there is a feature that’s missing in your current BIOS or a bug that’s affecting you and you need it fixed do not unnecessarily upgrade if all is well. Follow the old American adage: If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!6.	Enabling a global frame rate limit in Radeon Settings or the Nvidia Control Panel when you’re running Free/G sync may prevent some games from running in full screen mode. I had this problem when I had used Radeon settings and set the Global Frame Rate Target Control setting to 74 FPS it made the display hang when trying full screen with Elite Dangerous and Far Cry 4. Disabling this setting fixed it this was an accidental discovery I made that had me scratching my head for a long time wondering what’s wrong and I do hope this helps out someone in a similar situation.7.	Lastly when enabling a frame rate limit such as above set it to one below the max refresh rate of the monitor so 143 FPS for a 144Hz panel.And with that we’re done with this humongous post congratulations and thank you for having gone through it! I hope this helped you in some way and do feel free to reach out with any questions/suggestions you may have. Wish you the very best ahead!**LINUX:**Do NOT get ANY Gigabyte AM4 motherboard if you're planning on using anything Linux.

"I just came home to my CPU and Motherboard boxes waiting for me. However the Mobo box was much heavier than I expected. Much heavier.  Turns out they shipped 20 MSI Mobos to me. I called support and told them what happened and she told me I can keep them. I don’t believe her so I will be keeping them because the store is for sure going to want them back. If not idk what to do with them.edit: Picture belowhttps://imgur.com/a/XIGAhrj"
"So I helped a friend with his PC that he's had for a little less than a year the other day because it would crash every time he right clicked in explorer or the desktop. I've never seen a PCs software be so fucked up in such little time. After uninstalling a bunch of stuff and going through files deleting anything suspicious or unnecessary I first ran a third party virus scan and both a full search and offline search in windows defender there were a total of 50 detections(I don't even know how he could possibly have that many viruses). I then ran sfc scan multiple times until it no longer found stuff to repair and now he can at least right click without crashing."
"I have a decent computer (9600k and 1660s) but I was getting frustrated because every once in a while my computer would lag out. Like the mouse would stutter programs would freeze then everything would fast forward to get to where it should have been.I tried changing the ram thinking it was because they were mismatched. The problem persisted causing much frustration (imagine you're going to type a word document then suddenly your computer stops working then suddenly the document snaps to the top of the page).Finally I found out what the problem was. I had the desktop background set to slideshow and the accent color to change based on the picture. Every time the background changed my computer would lag out.Tldr having the accent color of windows change with the background caused my computer to lag hard.Edit: thanks for the awards!

"[This article explains it well.

In short the answer is yes sort of. But Hallock provided a longer answer explaining that 90C is normal a [Ryzen 9 5950X](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-9-5950x-review-benchmarks-performance/) (16C/32T up to 4.9GHz) [Ryzen 9 5900X](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-9-5900x-review-benchmarks-performance/) (12C/24T up to 4.8GHz) and [Ryzen 7 5800X](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-review-benchmarks-performance/) (8C/16T up to 4.7GHz) at full load and 95C is normal for the [Ryzen 5 5600X](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-review-benchmarks/) (6C/12T up to 4.6GHz) when spinning its wheels as fast as they will go.  >  >"Yes. I want to be clear with everyone that AMD views temps up to 90C (5800X/5900X/5950X) and 95C (5600X) as typical and by design for full load conditions. Having a higher maximum temperature supported by the silicon and firmware allows the CPU to pursue higher and longer boost performance before the algorithm pulls back for thermal reasons" Hallock said."
"EDIT:Asked the school like a lot of you suggested. Turns out that the system requirements were a bit out dated and the reason they wanted Intel is because of issues with running VMs. At the time they wrote it the only common factor with those students that had issues with running VMs were that they all ran AMD. Since then though the newer AMD architectures have been working fine and I'm OK to use my R5 1600.Here are their specific processor restrictions: VMware Workstation 15.x Player   Systems using Processors (CPUs) launched in 2011 or later are supported **except**:   \- Intel Atom processors based on the 2011 “Bonnell”  micro-architecture (e.g. Atom Z670/Z650; Atom N570)   \- Systems using Intel  Atom processors based on the 2012 “Saltwell” micro-architecture (e.g.  Atom S1200 Atom D2700/D2500 Atom N2800/N2600.   \- Systems using AMD  processors based on the “Llano” and “Bobcat” micro-architectures (e.g.  code-named “Hondo” “Ontario” “Zacate” “Llano”) &#x200B;Hi everyoneI'm taking a Computer IT diploma program starting this September. The school sent out the spec requirements for our computers and I was surprised to see that it was specifically stated NOT to have an AMD processor.I've done a free programming course online before using C and Python and I've never had a problem using my current PC (Ryzen 5 1600).Do I really need to buy a new CPU (which means I will also need a new MOBO)? I'd really rather not have to shell out more money on a new CPU and MOBO.Will having an AMD CPU cause future issues with programming software?Here are the software we are expecting to be using according to the orientation:* MS Office* MS Visual Studio* .Net* Java* Eclipse* Variety of Other programsThe computer labs at the school are currently using Windows macOS Linus and UNIX operating systems.Thanks guys! Appreciate the help!&#x200B;EDIT: Thank you everyone! As some of you have suggested I think I'll just keep my current system and use the labs if I come across any hicups with AMD. Thank you again!"

"This has been still is and might always be my biggest challenge with pc specs: my tiny brain cannot remember (let alone understand) the names of all these parts especially GPUs.This is what a typical specs discussion looks like to me:"What are the minimum specs I should be looking for?""You should have an AMD AssCheek-RX E-9972-Delta 6+6+2 Super DualCore HyperProcessor Giga Power Drive 82""I have an AMD ShitFart-DX P-9983-Delta 8+8 Mega QuadCore SuperProcessor Giga Power Drive RGB-X 46 Version 7.4 is that good enough?""No obviously it's not idiot""
"Posted my leftover GTX 1070 FE online as I just came into ownership of a 3060TI. I received a message from a guy that says "Hey what are the specs??" -- a little odd to me I felt that was a weird question coming from someone buying a 5yr old GPU. I assumed you would know the specs before clicking on the ad. I responded with a link to the NVIDIA website (with all specs) and reassured him it was the Founder's Edition. His follow up was... "Is this the complete set?" -- At this point I realized he had no idea what he was talking about. Before I could think of a reply he followed up with "Sorry I don't know anything my son wants one" -- I started with "Does your son already have a computer? This ad is for one specific part (a GPU) and there are no sets." -- Turns out his son does NOT have a computer at all.I told this guy (who was super nice btw)  that he needs to purchase an entire computer (please quit calling it 'a set') and if it's desired to be for gaming it will need to have a GPU. I told him to google some articles/sites for "prebuilt gaming computers 2021" and look on sites like Bestbuy/Newegg/Microcenter. I left him with a piece of advice - most people trying to sell old GPUs for high prices are not going to care. Someone would very easily answer "Yes this is complete set" and not think anything about it. People don't care. Imagine if you were this kid and you get a 5yr old GPU for a computer that doesn't exist.I hope kid if you are out there - you get a gaming PC this Christmas."

"My dog peed in the kitchen this morning while I was showering didn’t really think much of it at first even though it was quite a big puddle. I then go down to the basement where my PC sits and on the edge of the desk I instantly notice and smell dog pee that sprayed everywhere basically another puddle worth of it. Then I look and see there’s a tiny holy in the floor that a nail must have used to been and by some 1 in a million chance it was directly above where my PC sits and literally landed all over the top of my tower; and I could see it sprayed all over the glass and inside of the components. I knew it was fucked that instant the 2080 Ti was soaked right in all the parts that mattered. I just bought it and build this PC about 6 months ago whole build was worth around $2400 I believe. With that said I think that the graphic card might have took the most of the damage. There still some dried up pee stains that I can see kinda just flew everywhere when it hit the card and it got on like the shells of the SSD and ram and stuff but the CPU seems fine. The computer still turns on and runs and sounds quiet as normal nothing would occur to be different. The main problem is there is no display now I took the GPU out and plugging the monitor into the HDMI port on the back still doesn’t make anything pop up. The monitor just says no signal and then turns off. Can I still possibly use the intel integrated graphics? I have no idea how to access bios now or what to do but it does seem like the PC should still work otherwise. So any advice how to go about after this shitty unlucky situation would be appreciated thank you.Edit: can people stop messaging me saying I need to take better care of my dog? Today has been shitty enough and I already commented what happened down below If u also feel like saying that. Btw - the PC was already on when the pee got into it it was idling for a few hours before hand"
"I finally found a founders edition RTX 3070 and I picked it up today. I opened it up to see what it looks like and like a F\*CKING IDIOT I was standing over it with my mouth open and drooled a little into the vent in the middle. As you can expect I panicked. I immediately turned it upside down and wiped in between the fan grills as best I could. I definitely got some of it out but I'm afraid some of it got pretty deep in there.This is an insane question so I don't know if anyone will know this but what're the chances of it still working when I get my PC up and running? Not all of my parts are here so I won't be able to try it for a week or 2. Can moisture affect the card when power isn't going through it? By the time I actually try the card it should be dry. Any sympathy people wanna throw at me would be nice too. Sigh."
"I built a new PC last summer so that I could both upgrade and give my little brother an awesome birthday present in the form of my previous rig (i5-6500 & 1060 6GB). I really wanted to bump from 1080p and shaky 144 fps to 1440p consistent 144 fps; while selecting parts I think I really focused too much on the times that I wanted to play triple A games and my PC struggled. I ended up splurging on a top of the line system with a 2080 Ti alongside a 9700k. I don't really regret the purchase because I had really low expenses at the time so I could afford it but looking back at the last year of gaming on this machine is a bit painful when I consider what a high percentage of my time has been spent in World of Warcraft Hearthstone CS:GO and gamecube emulators for Smash Bros. I definitely achieved my goal of having top of the line performance on the occasions I play a triple A game and in VR but man did I overbuild relative to most of my time I spend on my PC.Do most of you running crazy "it's not much but it's mine" builds play demanding games a majority of the time or is mine a common experience? Those of you who are aware that you mostly play easy to run titles do you still feel a desire to upgrade your rig or are you happy with yours since it runs the games that are important to you well enough?"

"First of all I love this group. I don't post ever here but I always come to it to read up on builds and such. Anyway I had bought two lian li cases dynamic 011 last year. One.is my air cool build. So I gave my dad my xbox one s. He slowly started to game more and more until he played my pc. He said his Fav game Battlefield 1 looked better but also felt more responsive. So two days ago I took the extra lian li case that I was intended to use for a first time water cool.build with the money I had saved and used it for air cooling for my dad's build instead. I probably wont get a chance to build a water cool build for a long time. But my dad is my hero and he deserves this. Btw My cable management is not that good still but I'm learning and getting better. I recently got me a rx 5700xt sapphire nitro+ from a friend. So I gave my dad my vega 56. I already have two 8 gig sticks of ram for him too. I bought the CPU a ryzen 3600. The kraken aio x73. And the motherboard I had a spare of as well. And I bought a 850watt psu evga gold rated. I also had extra fans. This is the result. Recorded at night for ultimate visual.https://imgur.com/a/LbdrGYS Just gave it to my father. Dude legit broke down in tears. And is so happy!!!

We invited a couple friends from out of town for New Years and spent almost the entire weekend gaming together.  Fiancé had a blast doing it on his new rig!  He's tested out his favorites (Dark Souls 3 Witcher 3..) and he's blown away by the new graphics and performance.  Our friends now want to build their own rigs imagine that!So in closing thank you so much to this community for your help!  We are so happy he loves his new computer and you guys are awesome for helping in making this all work out so wonderfully. "
"As promised I decided to look into this prevalent stance; that you should get a slightly more powerful PSU than you need right now in case you want to upgrade for example the GPU down the line for a more powerful one. It makes sense but perhaps mostly for people who upgrade a lot.I can't make polls and even if I could they wouldn't be very statistically significant anyway so I'll just go ahead and ask here: Have you been saved by your previous forward thinking of beefing up the PSU when you upgraded something (GPU etc)? Have you bought a more powerful PSU than you needed but never did upgrade and now perhaps you've exchanged it anyway for whatever reason?"
"So yesterday I was in a discord call with this guy I know and he asked me for help with his PC saying "I get low FPS and don't know why is it my graphics card or something?" So I ask him to share his screen and immediately I see a Lenovo logo in the bottom right of the screen.. not a good sign. I then ask him to show me his task manager which showed 60% CPU usage and 60% RAM usage with only discord open in the foreground. He had stuff like McAfee bunch of different Lenovo software NZXT Cam and some other stuff running in the background. I told him to uninstall some things and change some settings and within 15 minutes or so I got his usage down to 4% CPU and 30% RAM. Not the best but definitely better than before. His games are now running much better and have a higher and more stable FPS.Take care of your PCs guys and don't install a bunch of unnecessary shit that will run in the background and destroy your performance."

"Since I upgraded to this new case I was having problems with my wireless mouse. The last few days it was fine but this evening it started again. It's this super annoying thing where my mouse stutters like hell. Anyway I thought back a few hours to remember what I might have done to trigger it again then it occured to me that I plugged a USB 3.0 drive into the port right next to the receiver of my mouse. I unplugged it and voila it's all gone. Then I googled it and turns out it's a documented phenomenon that USB 3.0 can and does cause interference in the 2.4ghz band. I can even reproduce it. The mouse starts acting up again when I plug in that USB drive and push some bits through the connector.Sharing it here because imo this is useful information.https://www.bluetoothandusb3.com/the-explanationhttps://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/usb3-frequency-interference-paper.pdf**edit for all the "could this be causing my particular wireless problem" comments**: The majority of wireless devices out there use the 2.4ghz band due to licensing regulations. X360 controllers Dualshock controllers wireless headphones bluetooth dongles proprietary receivers of logitech or whatever wifi antennae cordless phones lots of things. So yes it could very well be causing that problem with your wireless thingy."
"I've recently built 2 PC's for friends both had the same budget so I recommended almost identical components for them. (R5 3600 RTX 2060 2x8GB Ram 3200mhz cl16)I've recommended a couple cases for them as well that didn't break their budget of 800€ and were good performers regarding airflow but one of them wanted a more aesthetically pleasing one/didn't like mesh designs.They both use the stock cooler and have 2 fans in their system as of now but one of them has the Corsair 275R Airflow while the other went for a MSI case with suboptimal airflow.The Corsair's temps are sitting at 60-69C° under load for both CPU and GPU while the MSI gets noticeably hotter (around 70-77 for GPU and 75-80 for CPU).My point is if you're on a budget you don't want to spend more on fans and aftermarket coolers airflow should be the focus when choosing a case.Good choices would be the P300A P400A and P500A from Phanteks the Silverstone Fara R1 the Coolermaster NR600 TD500 mesh and H500 the Fractal Meshify C the Corsair 275R Airflow and 4000D Airflow the Lian Li Lancool 2 Mesh and the be quiet! Pure Base 500DX depending on your budget."
"He has also been running at 60hz on a 165hz 1440p display which is why I discovered this rabbit hole in the first place. He's had the setup for over a year. I'm crying.[https://imgur.com/a/94AjnFD](https://imgur.com/a/94AjnFD)He hadn't even noticed the GPU's video ports cause of the plugs on them.&#x200B;Edit whole story: He was trying to install MSI control center or whatever and was struggling cause msi's apps are shit apart from afterburner. I tried to help in a discord which is when I noticed he was only running at 60hz on a 165hz monitor. When we went to change it in nvidia control panel I noticed the display settings weren't there. When we tried to figure out why that was I found out his display was using intel UHD graphics which is when I started screaming and asked him to send a picture of the back of his case. The rest is history."

I’m just curious if anyone else has had the same experience.Hey! I was curious if anyone else has the same “problem” that I have (it’s not really a problem I know she’s just proud of me but it’s kinda annoying) where my mother has been telling EVERYONE she knows that her son built a pc all by himself. Whenever we meet up with family that I haven’t seen for a bit the first thing she says is “Christian built a pc you know.” I’m curious if anyone else has had the same or a similar circumstance to this."

"Hi guys just wanted to share my stupidity from few days ago. Here I was unboxing my Dark Rock Pro 4 for my 3700x to replace the stock jet turbine it comes with. All good and well after some elbow grease and swear words I was able to fit the monster in my case. It probably was the hardest part to install in this whole new build. Now I was expecting some amazing temperatures but just when I go into the bios the CPU reaches 70 degrees but I blame it on “it’ll settle in Windows”. After a Cinebench run that brought it over to a toasty 95 degrees I blame the Arctic Mx-4 application and start disassembling the whole thing again pretty pissed at this point. Well what do I find when I remove the cooler? The bloody protection film on the cooler. Yes I did the same mistake one guy in this sub did few months ago. I felt ashamed and stupid. I corrected my mistake and not I never get more than 62 degrees in Cinebench. A story of happiness disappointment and redemption. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.Edit: Thanks kind strangers. It’s my most liked post and my first awards."
"Hello PC builders - all three million of you!2020 hasn't exactly been a vintage year so far but it's heartening to see quite so many people getting involved both with their own hardware and with helping others on /r/buildapc. We're genuinely proud to be part of a community that despite its size has held on to its spirit of generosity and patience in helping others. That's pretty rare and it's all down to you your altruism and your presumably crippling fear of buyer's remorse.No grand giveaways or announcements this time (though rest assured we've got a few things planned over the coming months) just a big old thank you from the modteam to the community. Keep doing what you're doing and we'll try not to break anything on our end./r/buildapc modteam"
"So yesterday I realized that my monitor was plugged into the motherboard rather than my 3060 TI. I been playing like that for a while and wondering some games were bad to run on. WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

" So my younger brother came over to my house today with a pc he found in the trash at his work. It was a mini pc(intel nuc i3). He’s not very computer savvy so he had me look at it. He’s a pharmacy employee and it was lying at the top of the trash pile. He asked his boss if he could have it and she said if it’s in the trash then it’s fair game. I should say that it was in its plastic wrap when he brought it to me so I knew it hadn’t been used yet. I proceed to plug it in and boot it up. As soon as it turns on it goes straight to a slide show with images of how to protect yourself froM covid-19. I turned it off and tried to get to the boot menu (spamming f2 as it turns on) only to find out it was password protected. I then turn to the lovely internet to see how to get past that and find that by taking it out of the shell there a jumper pin that if removed allows you to reset or delete the password. Once I get to the bios screen it was as simple as booting windows from a usb. Free little computer for my bro! UPDATE: Thanks every one for the comments and votes! Yeah it was brand new(still in the box with all the components still in the original plastic.) I think the store mentioned had gotten a couple and didnt know what to do with the spares. He asked his boss if it was okay to take and she said yeah. I used to work for target and I’ve gotten a couple nifty items for free this way as well.  All I know from the specs is that it’s a i3 Intel cpu with on board graphics. It had 8gb of Laptop style RAM. Other than that not very sure. It originally had ubuntu as the OP. The bios screen was password protected. Probably with the original password intel provided. I just took it apart and took the yellow jumper plug of the mobo. When it’s taken off it allows you to get delete or reset the password. I just deleted it all together. Then once I rebooted it and spammed the f2 key to get to the bios screen there wasn’t a password. I just used an old windows 10 boot usb stick to install windows. Pretty straight forward. It also had a small WiFi card. Somebody said to get rid of the hdd but there wasn’t one in there( there is a slot to add a 2.5 sata drive) it had a m.2 sata chip installed with 250gb that originally had the Ubuntu op and cvs slide show. Retail price for a 2nd gen nuc is 280$. He doesn’t play any hardcore pc games but he does play with emulators so he will probably just add a gameboy Nintendo 64 and psx to it and with 200+ Gb he can add a ton of Roms. Plus browse the web and do his email."

"I was playing r6 and my temps were normal suddenly my pc shuts down and i smell burning. I immediately pulled out the power cord and opened my side panel and saw a dead fly on top of my gpu.

"I don't know who needs to hear this but I recently bought a 1TB HDD bcs my 500gb M.2 just wasn't cutting it. I wanted to download warzone and even before that I already used more than half of the storage.I spent weeks deliberating on whether to get another 500gb SSD or 1TB HDD. I mean buying the HDD saves me more than half of the price of the SSD (w double the storage!). Not to mention I was unsure if another 500gb would be enough in the long run. I weighed the pros and cons. The only cons of the HDD was the noise tbh. The last time I had used a HDD was more than 2 years ago on my laptop so I've pretty much forgotten the noise it made and I never really saw anyone explicitly complain about the noise. Well here I am complaining about the noise to those who have forgotten how annoying it is. It's annoying.Two days ago I bit the bullet and got myself the HDD. Installed it and everything seems to run smooth. Now I didn't really notice it on the first day but the next day after I had downloaded games into it I noticed it was *kinda* loud upon booting but after 30 seconds or so it quiet down a bit. Now idk if it's because I'm so used to my pc being silent but the sound is irritating me to hell and back. If I'm wearing headphones or put on music on speakers then it isn't such an issue but when there's nothing to drown it out that's when I get irritated. Anyway just a short rant to say I wish I had gone for the SSD lmao. Oh well will probably upgrade it when I start working. Am just a good ol' unemployed fresh grad for now.Edit: just wanted to clarify that I'm still using my m.2 for booting the HDD is for my secondary storageEdit2: also a comment mentioned setting the hdd on idle when it's not being accessed? Works like fucking magic for when I'm not playing games. ThanksEdit3: I really didn't expect it to get so many awards 😂 I think thats the only upside to me being an impatient idiot huh. Anyway thank you for the awards I hope I've helped a few of you decide which one you wanna go for. (Again this post is mostly for those who haven't used HDD in a long time. If the sound doesnt bother you good for you. I hope I can be the same in a week or two) (and yes I know this sounds like a first world problem but if I could have afford a 1TB SSD without batting an eye I defo would have gone for it believe me) Much love guys."
"Howdy folksAs you may or may not be aware the PC component market is reeling from a multitude of factors. Graphics Cards are extremely hard to come by selling out instantly even at inflated prices and being resold on the second hand market for many times their original retail price. However the issues run deeper than this with a combination of Covid-19 cryptocurrency mining tariffs production limitations and other supply and demand factors coinciding to mean that finding graphics cards has become incredibly frustrating and the pricing on some other components is inflated whilst availability is limited. This situation has persisted since late 2020 and current trends do not show any sign of improvement for GPU availability specifically. We all want to build great PCs and right now it’s hard and that sucks.**We ask for your help during these shortages by requesting that you pay mind to the following:*** We cannot predict when this situation will ease or end. No one has a crystal ball.* Don’t ask us how to buy a GPU. You can read about others’ experiences and see if you can emulate them with the time and skills you have available but no-one has an easy answer. People are finding GPUs at retail and patience is one of the primary methods that yields rewards.* Some people might decide to use bots to assist them in making a purchase. On /r/buildapc we do not condone the discussion recommendation or advertisement of bots.* Please don’t get scammed. This is a fraught market and fraudsters will exploit your desire to buy a GPU. If a product is being sold by a third party below market price in all probability it is bait for a scam. Never send money by bank transfer Paypal Friends & Family or strange cash apps you’ve not heard of until your seller suggests them. Engage in any non-retail transaction with extreme caution. Ensure any payments you make are covered by robust buyer protection. We will not permit topics such as ‘Is this a scam?’ or ‘Did I get scammed?’* Do not offer to sell or ask to buy components in this subreddit or via direct message. Posts will be removed and posters banned. * Be kind to one another. Some people may choose to pay inflated prices. Other people may mine with their GPUs. Neither of those make abuse or harassment acceptable and we will take action against breaches of our rules concerning civility. **In the meantime there are ways to build a PC now despite the GPU shortage:** You could build a stop-gap system with graphics output integrated into the CPU or search for cheaper older used cards such as the AMD RX480/570/580 or Nvidia GTX 970/1060. Somne weaker cards are no longer optimal for mining and so may be more readily available. There are many possible solutions and we’re sure the buildapc community can help you if you need a PC right now and can’t wait for supply to catch up to demand. **To keep the rest of the subreddit on topic please keep discussion of the GPU shortages retail frustrations etc. to this thread only. Other submissions will be removed.***(Reviewed 24th August 2021)*"
"I have no idea where the time went. I thought I'd be at it for an hour or two max. I mean [it was worth it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14mLdp4_5nLHnusj4cWvwq8bsmQjD7rVs/view?usp=sharing) but holy cow.Alcohol and compressed air cleaning all over. Surprised at how much dust was in it especially considering I'm running positive pressure and keeping it off the floor. Improved cable management. I'm sure a hundred people could tell me a hundred things I could have done differently or better but this is legitimately the best cable management I've ever done and I'm so happy about it right now... even if it is mostly on the side behind a tinted glass panel and facing a wall...Also did a successful SATA Power Cable reversal (I was so nervous about that) and did the washers mod on the 5700 XT. While in there I also cleaned the insides and put on a nice layer of brand new Kryonaut. Not noticing significant temp differences but I am getting a 5dB reduction from where I'm seated (33dB before 28dB after) which is so incredibly nice.Just... felt pretty proud of myself honestly. Wanted to share it with someone. Have a nice day!**Edit:** WOW! I was just feeling good about actually sitting down and getting this done. It's been hard to get motivated lately. This response has been overwhelming and the fact that it's overwhelmingly positive has been pretty nice too! Thank you so much.Here she is back where she belongs!

"Short story short I've been playing on 60 fps up until now. Let this serve as a PSA that you have to set your refresh rate in Windows. Right click on your desktop go to display settings at the bottom hit advanced display settings and chose your refresh rate. **If anyone says they never noticed a difference going from 60 FPS to 140+ FPS it's a red flag that they 99% aren't playing on 140+ FPS whether it's because their settings are wrong or their monitor isn't plugged into their GPU.**EDIT: Since I'm getting the same comment dozens of times it was my first monitor above 60hz so I hadn't ever actually experienced >60hz and figured I just couldn't tell the difference."
"Consider undervolting your GPU. Modern cards keep trying to boost as high as possible generate a bunch of unnecessary heat ramp the fans up to dissipate that heat and end up clocking down slightly when they heat up to equilibrium. With a modest undervolt the performance of your GPU should not change significantly (provided you don't overdo it) and you can significantly reduce heat output by reducing power draw which in turn makes your fans spin slower which means a quieter card.------------A quick "how-to" undervolt on modern Nvidia GPUs (you may need to find a different guide for AMD)1- Get MSI Afterburner and a GPU benchmark or game.2- At stock settings run the benchmark/game for a bit and see what clock speed your GPU settles at when temperature is stable. Also note down power draw temperature fan RPM and a performance metric (benchmark score / game FPS).3- In MSI afterburner open the curve editor. ~~Lower the whole curve down (alt+drag) then pick a voltage to bring up to the clock your GPU settled at on step 2 and apply (the rest of the curve should adjust to that clock in a straight horizontal line).~~ **Edit: different instructions leaves the point below your normal boost clock at a lower voltage. Thanks to u/BIueWhale for pointing this out:** Select the voltage point you want to undervolt to on the curve and alt-drag the whole curve up. Then shift-click and drag the graph background to the right of that point to select the higher end the curve. Lower that part of the curve so that everything lies below your undervolt point. Hit apply and the right side will flatten out. ([visual aid](https://imgur.com/a/ziS38Bo))With RTX-30 cards they normally operate at ~1000mv so you can start by going down in 25-50mv steps. For example my card settled on 1905 to 1935 mhz at step 2 so I targeted 1905mhz at 950mv initially.4- After applying the curve re-run the same benchmark/game as step 2. See if there was improvements (lower temps lower RPM) and no significant performance loss. If everything looks good consider undervolting further by lowering the voltage again another step and repeat the test. Eventually you'll run into instability. When you do go back up one step (or two to be extra safe). **EDIT2:** Once you're happy with your undervolt if using Afterburner don't forget to save it to a profile and click "Apply at Windows Startup" (the Windows logo on most Afterburner skins). Also set Afterburner to boot with Windows in the settings.------------Here's an example of a quick undervolt on an RTX 3080: Settings | Port Royale Score | Max Temp | Fan% | Power Draw---|---|----|----|----Stock (1905mhz) | 11588 | 73.6C | 53% | 378W1905mhz @925mv | 11578	| 69.8C | 47% | 322WAs you can see the score different is completely negligible but temps are down ~4C with the fans running slower all because the power draw is down ~56W.**TL;DR: Lower power draw = less heat generated = lower fan RPM = less noise. Take 20-30 minutes to dial in a stable undervolt**"
"I bought a 3700X and they delivered a 3800X instead.edit: A lot of questions about "why not just keep it?" As others have said  RMA will be a concern if something were to go wrong. Since I have the receipt for the 3700X they won't honor the warranty because I have a 3800X."
"1. Your cpu might have crack like sounds when being installed and pushing the lever back down don't freak out (immediately) because some CPUs will do this.2. Put your ram in before your CPU cooler if it might occupy  or require low profile memory as it will make dual installation a lot harder.3. Try and find out what orientation your motherboard is going to go into your case and preplace cables inside the case to those locations. (personally for me I won't do the PSU cables though.)4. Try and at least get good lighting when installing the motherboard in the case as it'll make your life so much easier.5. Make sure your IO shield isn't upside down when installing your motherboard or else you might spend 20 minutes like me figuring out why the motherboard isn't fitting the screw holes.6. Before screwing in your motherboard double check that all holes in your motherboard can be screwed.7. As painful as it is be extra sure that your putting in your case cables in the right place or your computer won't boot.8. Your motherboard is pretty resistant in fact most components to your computer are (CPU and Storage Drives are probably the most fragile). So when installing your 24 pin don't be afraid to use a good amount of force but also be sure to cable manage these well because in the event you need cable manage it somewhere else it'll be a pain to take out.9. Having friends in a call with you will also be a life saver sometimes it'll make the process go much faster if you have questions that need answered.10. When done make sure you have a good grip on the case before placing it to where you want it. don't want all that work going to waste!&#x200B;Edit: Here are some tips from YOU guys thanks for all the support as well.&#x200B;1. Build on your motherboard box when installing things on your motherboard. Doubles as cool packaging and an anti-static work station.2. If you have a giant CPU cooler it might be better to install it after screwing in the motherboard.(For me I was lucky to have a long magnetic screw driver that allowed me to screw it in normally at an angle.)3. pre cable manage the cables you can before installing your motherboard in your case.4. Don't have friends? Join the BuildAPC discord! You can have answers given to you with in seconds!5. Install as many parts as you can on your motherboard before it's in the case (with the exception of the GPU.)6. Try and find a video on installing your CPU cooler. Yes they'll have a manual when the time comes but having this knowledge prior and seeing how it's done visually will make the process go much faster. I spent less than 10 minutes installing mine.7. Each CPU requires thermal paste if your cooler doesn't have some pre-applied. There are quick infographics online showing you how much for certain CPU types. It's harder than you think to apply too much thermal paste.8. CPU cooler fan touching memory = fine CPU cooler heatsink touching ram heatsink = fine CPU heatsink directly touching ram = problem9. Manuals are good but youtube videos can make you go much faster. For me I probably read about one part in a manual to help me solve a problem. A quick youtube video shows you a visual example as well.10. Double check to see if you have spacers in your case before installing your motherboard. If not please make sure to get them from your case bag parts. Your motherboard CAN short circuit this way.11. Try and avoid installing  and uninstalling your cpu multiple times as each time could lead to a pin being bent.12. Make sure you know what needs power on your computer. An NVME drive for example gets its power directly from the mobo while other components will need cables directly from the PSU.13. Don't zip tie all your cables and reinstall your case sides before turning on your PC. Even though mine worked first try I did exactly this because I was expecting a problem.14. Make sure nothing has plastic on it. Some CPU coolers will have plastic on the giant metal part connecting to your CPU this could lead to horrible thermal throttling.15. Make sure your monitor is actually on when trying to boot for the first time. Happened to me I felt stupid and relieved at the same time.16. Turn on XMP when booting for the first time. It'll save you a bit of time and you could even forget about it. (had a friend who forgot once and was running @ 2666 for years.)17. Most drivers will be installed right when you plug in the internet but always double check by searching online automatically for new drivers.18. Magnetic screw drivers are going to be a savior when building a computer and I'd highly recommend getting one if you don't have one already.&#x200B;Took me just over 5 hours to build mine with few breaks in between. Don't be discouraged! For anyone curious as well [here's](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JHgTNP) my parts list. Good luck future builders!"
"[\--Imgur album here--](https://imgur.com/a/E8NZ6yo)So this was my project for the past months. A GameCube pc. I know I'm not the first one to do this but I do think that mine is one of the cleaner ones out there (in terms of how its built internally). There are multiple images in the linked Imgur gallery with various comments so please also take a look there too if you're interested. I'll include some generic comments here too.First the specs of the PC are:* AMD 3400G cpu/gpu* Asrock A300-STX motherboard* Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 [chromax.black](https://chromax.black)* 16GB G.Skill Ripjaws 3000mhz* 1TB Kingston A2000* Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200At the start of the project I had a few main goals (aside from of course getting a pc in a GameCube) and I can happily say that I have managed to tick all the boxes plus more :)1. **I wanted to have working GameCube controller ports**  This was one of the most important ones. I have GameCube controllers and also DK Bongos and it'd be great to be able to use them in Dolphin. The way I solved this was by taking a MayFlash GameCube USB adapter and then attaching the original GameCube ports to the adapter. And connecting the adapter to the internal USB2 header on the motherboard. There are a few pictures of this in the Imgur album.2. **I wanted the outside of the GameCube to be as original as possible**  I really wanted it to look like a GameCube. The only visible non-original GameCube part is the backplate which I custom-designed and 3d printed to fit the new back-io plus I added some more ventilation.Most other GameCube pcs I could find hollowed out the bottom of the GameCube creating more vertical space. I decided not to because that would mean the bottom (expansion) compartments of the original would have to be glued shut which I did not like. As you can see in the images the bottom compartments still look 100% original and usuable as some kind of storage.3. **I wanted the GameCube to be properly closed; i.e. not falling apart when you pick it up**  This one was tricky to make work together with point 2 and 4. The original GameCube is a sandwich of parts that are all tied together with 4 corner screws on the bottom that screw together the top and bottom case. I could not use those screws because the motherboard was larger than the original motherboard and thus overlapped the screwholes. I solved this by creating a custom 3d-printed motherboard tray and in essence creating my own sandwich. Sort of. It's difficult to explain in words. The only downside is that it still is not truly properly secured as part of the sandwich is still based on glue and thus hoping that the glue will hold…Not hollowing out the bottom did gave me a pretty neat bonus though: the front-io of the motherboard *perfectly* lines up with the first memory card slot. So this thing even has working front-io without having to dremel a hole for it haha. You could stick a usb stick in exactly the same place where you'd normally put your memory card.4. **I wanted to use as little glue as possible.**  First reason for this was that I think just gluing everything is not a very elegant solution. Second reason is that it allows for some form of upgradability. The only things that are glue is some standoffs that are used in the sandwich mentioned in part 2 and the 2nd memory-card flap. All the other stuff is attached using some form of screws and custom 3d-printed parts. I can take disassemble the entire thing with just a screwdriver. Whether it's truly upgradeable I'm not sure as the tolerances are pretty tight in some places and here and there stuff has been designed for exactly this hardware. But in theory it should certainly be possible to fit a new STX motherboard in here in the future (if they even exist: STX boards are a rare breed it seems). In any case it's at least certainly possible to upgrade e.g. the storage :)Furthermore I achieved the following small but noteworthy points:1. The disc flap top thingy still opens perfect fine.2. The power and reset buttons both work as power and reset buttons.3. The original power LED works just fine.Also in case anyone's wondering: temperatures seem to be fine. At least I haven't extensively monitored them yet so take this with a pinch of salt but playing some GameCube games in 1080p or running a benchmark seems to result in temps not much higher than around 70 degrees C. And that is with the top lid closed. Also I haven't yet fine-tuned the fan-curve but as it is it's already damn near silent (great cooler Noctua as always!)."

"For some background I just built my first pc about a month and a half ago. I got excited about the idea and found all of my pieces probably within a day. I was using PC part picker and had no idea what I was doing really. Well now now I’ve already replaced and resold my CPU GPU PSU fans and if it wasn’t such a hassle to swap out the case I’d do that too. Take your time and don’t rush things. Think your build through. If you want to go for a cheaper option really think if it’s worth it. You’ll save yourself a lot of money by being sure of what you’re getting."
"Many thanks in advance"
"I know I've seen this post before but if you are considering re-building because of performance and the build is old take it apart clean it and re-thermal paste the CPU and GPU.I have a nearly 5 yo build that has been giving me trouble. Today I took it apart cleaned out a metric ton of dust put new thermal paste on the CPU and GPU now it's running great. The old paste on both was crusty and dry.I also have new/faster/larger memory coming this weekend which I expect will help.Considering money is tight this is a much better alternative to re-building."
"I got really scared of fucking up but as soon as I heard the **click** sound I got more relieved. I still cannot believe I did it. It did not broke it did not failed to detect the lights turned on as soon as I turned on my PC.This is a dream right? I'm still shaking.EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone!Edit 2: some people are saying I did this for karma points or sending me chat messages thinking I'm trolling. I am not and I don't really care about karma I already posted on this sub before looking for help (which was very useful btw). I didn't expect this many positive messages I was a bit nervous when I put the sticks fearing that I would break them accidentally since they came in today after 7 days waiting. Anyway have a nice day!"
"https://imgur.com/gallery/cj550izI posted something here about this awhile ago but now it’s finally finished. Basically I built a literal toaster PC.Also I still need a name for it if anyone can think of anything.Hope you guys like it!EDIT: Wow thanks everyone for all the nice comments I’m glad people like this so much. I never posted the specs so here they are:- ASUS ROG Strix x-470- AMD Ryzen 7 2700x- Zotac GeForce 1080ti Mini- 32Gb Corsair DDR4 Vengeance RGB Pro 3200mhz- Corsair H100i Pro RGB AIOI haven’t done any benchmarking yet but the temps don’t seem too bad and air flow is decent throughout the case. I might make an update post in the future with benchmarks once I find a way to fit in that CD Drive I had to take out and another SSD right now it’s just the 480Gb M.2 on the motherboard."
"Very quick question:When it comes to increasing the overall life of my PC and preventing damage from a power outage (or power coming off/on) - Is it better to turn my PC off at night or put it to sleep?"
"Few days ago I have found a thread which show the appreciation towards pcpartpicker and there is no issue with that however sometimes we have forgot who really did help us during  the time we are having trouble with our PC no matter what the issue is recommendation or other pc related question. I just wanted to wholeheartedly thank you everyone in this subreddit that we are really grateful for everything you did for us fellow strangers. Even without gaining any profits you are using your time to provide us necessary information."
"So my husband is constantly working on his PC. It is his pride and joy. I literally know next to zero about computers even though I try really hard to listen haha. I know his most recent parts are a 3080 graphics card and he just installed a EVEA Hybrid Cooling Upgrade kit??? Something like an xc3. Anyway his birthday is soon and I was wondering what would best gift for someone who also loves to build computers? $500 and under range. Doesn't necessarily have to be a computer part!"
"I just thought it would be fun to share our "war stories" as a community to show those new builders afraid to make mistakes that it's okay. We all screw up from time to time. 99% of the time when you make a mistake all you harm is your ego. I've built around a dozen pcs for reference here's mine;About two months ago I did a brand new build for myself. It was quite the upgrade from fx-8350 and rx580 to R52600 and 5600xt. Newegg had lost my CPU and it took five weeks before I finally received it. As you can imagine I was in a hurry to get up and running and dig into some Red Dead Redemption 2. I get the build together it fires up first try except just one problem. There is no video output. I troubleshoot everything eventually rebuilding the entire thing. Still nothing. The PC is turning on but I have no video. I spend 4 hours trying to figure out what the issue is when finally I swap in the rx580 and that's when I realize. I had been plugging the HDMI cable into the motherboard...She runs great now and I couldn't be happier with it.Edit: Some of the stories involving thermal paste have me wondering about you guys :)"
"Due to a kernel memory vulnerability in Intel CPU's over the past decade a patch is required. Unfortunately intel cannot fix this via micocode so all operating systems (windows Linux Mac os etc) will need patches. These patches will give a 5-30% performance hit depending on the task and the CPU model. If you're planning on buying an Intel system I would recommend waiting for the patches to come out to see how bad it is. I doubt intel will lose their gaming lead but it is possible.AMD will not be affected by this issue as their architecture does not have this vulnerability. So if you have an amd system you have no need to be worried.More can be found on this article: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/Brilliant "explain this to me like I'm 5" [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/_/ds2x83j) by /u/name_censored_ in /r/sysadmin> Computer hides your treasure from the bad man. The bad man shakes the boxes to find your treasure. Computer has to spend more time hiding the treasure. Computer is slow now :(**EDIT: I want to point out that the "<=30%" claim is for people mostly running vm's. For your average task the issue will be closer to 5%. So don't feel like you made a huge mistake in your intel purchase. But like I said before wait for some benchmarks before you draw a conclusion. Some things may be affected and some might not.**Adding to this it's a very new bug (as in it's just recently been found) so nothing is in concrete at the moment. Expect things to change as time goes on. And just like the ryzen segmentation bug it's most likely blown out of proportion.**UPDATE: Some benchmarks have been released in windows. With an 3960x and a 1080 Ti at 1080p there was a 2-4% drop in performance. With dx12/Vulcan games taking the biggest hit. I'm guessing the 8700k is the best off. It would be interesting to see some benchmarks of pre-haswell systems without pcid and some post haswell. But I think it's safe to say for gaming the hit is very little for the 8700k.****If any of you would like to build a database of benchmarks with pre and post patches (the patch is is in latest windows insider build) please do. The more information we have about this the better.**More information can be found here: https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/prozessoren/45319-intel-kaempft-mit-schwerer-sicherheitsluecke-im-prozessor-design.html**UPDATE 2: Both intel and amd have this issue but and is not affected with the "meltdown" bug which is the one with the performance hit.**You can read more here in this table created by /u/nostraaugusta: https://i.imgur.com/RXVJl8j.jpgAs we know already the 8700k is basically not affected the performance difference is miniscule. But someone has done some benchmarks with a 4690k which on average has around a 5% drop. Ranging from 1.5% to 13% here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/7o2ctw I would like to add to this every CPU is acting differently on pretty much every game. Do not take this 4690k result as the same for every Benchmark. **Every CPU is different**"
"EDIT: This post has been supersepeded my by Motherboard tier list and featureset guide here:  https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/joo0s8/ryzen_5000_x570_b550_a520_motherboard_featureset/ You can still use this post as a companion post though. Welcome to the hyper in-depth guide B550 boards that outcompete a B450 Tomahawk Max at a similar Price Point.Final edit: Now that I have had time to sleep on it I like MSI B450 Pro VDH WIFI better. I still like the Pro 4 more. EDIT3: Guys I have spent 16 hours today writing this and answering questions with almost no breaks. I'm done for the night a lot people are asking questions I've already answered down below. Read some of my responses down below for example I've explained why the B550 Rog Strix Gaming F is a bad choice 3 times now. You guys are probably going to have to wait for my comprehensive how to choose a good Motherboard guide and that is still maybe a month out. It will be even longer then this and explain a lot of concepts I used here to review these mobos. Edit: Fixed some typos and move the section on Bios flashback to the B450 Tomahawk Max section. I meant to move it before but forgot. After 8 hours of straight work beginning at 4AM Pacific time here we are. It was supposed to take 2 and then I ended going way more in detail then maybe I needed to. Expect typos missed words and grammar errors. I finally feel I have enough data to kill the B450 Tomahawk max. For weeks I have been waiting to write this thread. Unfortunately English language reviews and data on the VRMs of one of these boards has been almost worthless. So I finally found the data I need by looking at random non English reviews. Since I don't speak these languages I have had parse what they are talking about thankfully a Chinese review had some English translation I was able to use. **EDIT2:** This morning as I was typing this up [hardware unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPH9pCCK-E&feature=youtu.be) finally posted their B550 guide with the board I was looking for VRM data + a lot more I was busy here writing this and that I missed the post. That is an excellent video on VRM thermals.However that video does have an error. He keeps saying certain boards have a USB 3.2 Gen 2 internal port. That is wrong. They do not. They have a USB 3.2 gen 1 half power port. Most B550s have this half power port including MSI's line up. Only very high end boards have true USB-C internal connectors. So while it connects to the USB-C port on case it only provides USB 3.2 gen 1 speeds (aka USB 3.0 speeds). You can check this on the specs sheet for the [MSI B550 Pro VDH WIFI](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B550M-PRO-VDH-WIFI/Specification) and click the detail tab. Scrolling down you will see this line: **1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 5Gbps Type-C port**. A USB 3.2 gen 2 port should run at 10GBps. [Here is a board with a True USB-C internal connector](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550%20PG%20Velocita/index.asp#Specification) scroll down and you will see - 1 x Front Panel Type C USB 3.2 Gen2 Header. The reason this error happened is because [USB Naming conventions fucking suck](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/usb-3-2-explained-making-sense-of-current-and-confusing-usb-standard/). end Edit2 more edit2s below.Disclaimer: the coronavirus is wrecking stocks. Prices listed here do not take into account COVID 19 stock issues. MSRP will be listed so you know if you are being gouged and there will be some options if a board goes out of stock. [MSRPs are taken from this list.](https://wccftech.com/amd-b550-motherboards-prices-unveiled-msi-asus-asrock-gigabyte/)The price range we are looking at is 100-130 dollars. I don't consider it a Tomahawk class board if it is priced outside of this range. However I will cover a few more expensive boards to show what you get for more money. If a board is not on the list I don't consider it a B450 Tomahawk Max replacement.**The B450 Tomahawk MAX MSRP $115** First let's talk about why the Tomahawk Max was and still is a great board. You don't have to return it if one is in the mail. However this sub did have an unhealthy obsession with that board and way too many people suggested it in situations where there were much better x570 options such as people who need advanced workstation features like thunderbolt 3 for example. **Here is how this board became defacto midrange MOBO for Ryzen 2000 and 3000 CPUs:** We need to understand that B450 was terrible. MOBO manufactures used B450 as a dumping ground for low end parts. So many B450s are almost unbuyable junk in terms of features. A B450 DS3H is a perfect example. Costs almost the same as the excellent Asrock B450m Pro4 but only has 1 fan header no 5v RGB bad VRMs no USB-C support for VR or USB-C devices whereas for few bucks more you can get all that on the Asrock B450m Pro4. And when boards had excellent non VRM featuresets such the Gigabyte B450 Aorus Pro well the VRMs were bad and couldn't even run a 3900x at stock let alone overclock a 3700x. This is why only a tiny amount of B450 boards were worth buying. The B450 Tomahawk stepped up. It's primary quality was that it had zero flaws. Most B450s have some flaws and many many had severe flaws. So while the Tomahawk Max did nothing amazing it also did nothing wrong and just not having a flaw is amazing in itself. So many of it's price point competitors had some issue where we had to say hey your rando b450 mobo can't run a 3900x at all even at stock so stop overclocking it and your system will work or this mobo lacks USB-C so your VR headset needs an add in card or this mobo has limited fan headers so you may need to buy a splitter cable. None of that with the B450 Tomahawk. **As for the Tomahawk's Features:** **VRMs:** It had VRMs that could run the whole Ryzen 3000 stack at stock and overclock everything up to a 3800x without overheating. Very few b450s and even some x470 boards could not do that simple task. **Non VRM featureset:** It's back panel I/O was a bit sparse with 5 USB ports which is a bit low but it also had USB-C which was great at this price point. And it add 6 audio jacks. **Internal connectors:** Were ok and competitive with most boards within 20 dollars of this board. You would have needed a a case with 6 USB ports for this to have an issue. If you need RGB well it had the older 12v RGB standard so can still have some RGB but it didn't have the most advanced at the time 5v RGB. **Audio codec:** It's audio codec was a lower end Realtek 892 codec and it's implementation wasn't great. But it still outperformed the lowest end Realtek 887s and the audio was still fine. If it had bad sounding audio half the internet would be up in arms as it was by far the most popular board and instead it's considered acceptable.**LAN** The Realtek 8111h LAN chip (NIC) is a perfectly acceptable chip that works fine. Especially at this price point.***Special Features:**The Tomahawk Max has Bios Flashback. This allows you to update the BIOS without a CPU. So you can buy this board and update the BIOS without a CPU. This can also save borked overclocks. This is a cool feature.There are several misconceptions that have been spread about this that I need to address. First: This the default way to upgrade your BIOS. WRONG. This was always meant to be an emergency feature rather then the defacto way to update your BIOS. Ask the massive amount of people had their B450 Tomahawks bricked at the launch of Ryzen 3000. This should not be trusted as 100% way to update a BIOS and a CPU update is always better. Second: Boards that don't have this feature will never be compatible with next gen CPUs without a BIOS update from the user. WRONG. Before Ryzen 3000 MOBO manufacturers [already had the Ryzen 3000 update](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-3000-valhalla-cpus-x370-x470-motherboard-bios-support/) in March 2019 4 months before the launch of Ryzen 3000. Most MOBOs on the market will very quickly support Ryzen 3000 and many legit retailers update their BIOS in store both Newegg and Microcenter in the US had employees who posted here that they were updating their B450 MOBOs BIOS before launch. Whether that was 100% true or they only updated MOBO boxes that weren't sealed as some companies do I don't know. I know the vast majority of people in the US who bought near the launch got already updated MOBOs. Within a very short time every mobo on the market will have the new BIOS update. If you do get a MOBO with an incompatible BIOS and no RYZEN 4000 sticker just return it and demand an updated one. There is no reason you should receive a non updated board from a legit retailer even at launch. **Tomahawk Max Conclusion:**So as we can see this board isn't perfect but it does everything just fine. The issue I always had with it was when people started adding things like 35 dollar WiFi cards making this board a $150 board instead of buying a $150 Asrock X570 Phantom Gaming 4 WIFI which is better in nearly every way and had built in WiFi. Or adding a 12v to 5v RGB converter for $15 so now you have a $130 board when the Asus Prime x570 P is $140 and is better in almost every way again and you get ASUS aura sync for your RGB a much better software then MSI Mystic Light which is famously bad.This is the reason the B450 Tomahawk Max became the default lower end and lower midrange Ryzen mobo. While I do feel this sub had an unhealthy obsession with it in the end it is a perfectly fine option that will power your build for years. No reason to send it back if you have one coming.**Requirements for a Tomahawk Class B550 board:**So what we need are boards that have these requirements. VRMs capable of overclocking an 8 core and running a 3950x at stock. It needs solid internal connectors that can connect to nearly all of the common Cases on the market. It needs back panel I/O with USB-C. It needs at minimum a Realtek 892 audio codec and a realtek 8111h LAN chip. I don't consider special features a requirement but if they are there I will list them. Finally the board must be priced as close to $115 USD as possible.**So let's get look at B550 Options:****Board 1: The Board that has has killed the Tomahawk MAX dead. I actually put my money where my mouth is and bought this board.****The B550m Pro4 MSRP: $115****Overview:**This micro ATX board has done what no other micro ATX board has done yet. Made an mATX board that has been so much better then any of it's ATX price point competitors that it is massively worth buying over the ATX boards. For years mATX and SFF fans have been asking why people don't buy mATX boards when they never use the extra PCIe slots. The answer is simple. Most mATX boards are dumping grounds for low end parts and the ones that were competitive just weren't compelling over the ATX counterparts. NOT HERE. This board is amazing. Every concern you have with an mATX board is mitigated with this boards excellent and best in class at this price point featureset. **VRMs:** This boards VRMs are the thing that has single handedly kept this post from going up. Hey here is a little hint as nice as the high end boards are the midrange and lower boards are where the volume is get that info out quicker. ~~Since hardware unboxed and gamers nexus and others so far have dragged their feet so damn long I started looking at non English sources.~~Edit2: Hardware Unboxed has done a [VRM video](https://youtu.be/wuPH9pCCK-E?t=656) on these boards. You can see my info down below turned out to be correct. The Pro4 has good Tomahawk Class VRMs.So according to this [sweary Chinese review](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ma4y1J7iR?from=search&seid=4010612445506922362) with some English subtitles the VRMs on this board can OC a 3800x just fine. And a max OCed 3900x will cause thermal throttling and crash the board. That is fine and what we would expect from a Tomahawk MAX. So the conclusions that can be drawn are the VRMs are fine for overclocking 3800x and should run a 3950x at stock speeds no problem. I have yet to find any one who has tried this but I 99% guarantee they will run a 3950x at stock no problem. All the data indicates the VRMs are exactly the same tier as a Tomahawk max or may be even slightly better within that tier. I do need to address one thing as it has already come up from some people in Gamers Nexus best [b550 boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihg6XQiqW7A) buildzoid lists this board. So it made GNs best B550s list. Unfortunately he used the the term terrible for this board's VRMs and now many think it has actually terrible VRMs despite him in that very same review saying they can run a 3950x at stock. That would mean the VRMs are not terrible but good. I think GN Steve needs to get on buildzoid a bit about hyperbole because these VRMs are not terrible as my data above shows. A defacto language has sort of sprung up where terrible VRMs mean can't overclock a 6 core. Bad VRMs can't OC an 8 Core Good VRMs like a Tomahawk max can OC an 8 core but not a 12 core great VRMs can handle a 12 core and excellent can handle everything and top tier is even better. Overwhelmingly people describe the VRMs on a TOMAHAWK MAX as GOOD so to call VRMs in that tier terrible is not a great look especially when buildzoid didn't hate the B450 Tomahawk VRMs back in the day at the Tomahawk's price point. On that note I'm going just copy pasta something I said to someone who brought this up Buildzoid's overview was done without real world testing and that has been come up before. He doesn't test most of the VRMs he reviews in the real world but he goes by listed specs of circuits and mosfets and theory crafts from there. Buildzoid hated the VRMs on the Asrock X570 Pro4 but he never did real world testing only theory. Hardware unboxed tested the x570 Pro4 in [the real world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbyWKufthS4) and found they punched above their weight class and were better then Buildzoid thought. Hardware Unboxed even felt they were good enough to show off as an example of good vrms on budget x570 [in this b-roll](https://youtu.be/xbyWKufthS4?t=1073) shot here. This doesn't mean Buildzoid is wrong or a bad source his info is top tier but it does show where real world testing matters. Furthermore Buildzoid is about hardcore overclocking so if for example the x570 Pro4 runs a little too hot for him and his extreme OC for a normal OCer they would be much more adequate. Finally when buildzoid says can handle or is capable of he means can overclock at high levels not run at stock. Buildzoid is a great primary source for info for almost everyone hardware unboxed gamers nexus and so on including me I love the guy but you really need to understand how the guy does his work to parse what he is saying.  The VRMs on the B550m Pro4 are the same as the x570 pro4 but they have 1 less phase. Every indication I have is that they punch above their weight class. I would love to see a comparison to the b450 Tomahawk. Hopefully we get real world testing in English soon. **Non VRM featureset:** This board is SO good here and better then the ATX versions in many ways. This [excellent review](https://youtu.be/2IhxtAP5yFM?) covered this super in depth. By the way that is one of the best MOBO reviews I have ever seen. Much better then most popular tech tubers.  **Audio Codec:** is the Realtek 1200 high end audio codec. This is a high end audio codec that appears on higher end midrange boards like the Gigabyte X570 elite/z490 elite. In the review I mentioned above we actually have [testing data on this](https://youtu.be/2IhxtAP5yFM?t=342). From the above review we can see the B550m Pro4 performs almost as well as $190 mobos. On top of that it noticeably out performs the B350 Tomahawk which had one of the better implementations of the Realtek 892 and much better implementation then the B450 Tomahawk which had a rather poor implementation of it's [realtek 892 audio codec](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13371/the-msi-b450-tomahawk-motherboard-review/5).So the B550m Pro4 notably outperforms the b450 Tomahawk Max in audio performance.**LAN chip:** Both boards use the Realtek 8111h which is a perfectly fan lan chip and exactly what you would expect at this price point. The Tomahawk Max is equal to the B550m Pro4 here. **Internal Connectors:** So good for this price point. 6 fan headers 1 for the CPU 1 for an AIO amazing equal to or better then many ATX boards. It has 2 more then an X570 Elite. So you can run this board in an standard size ATX case with a modern 3x1 3 intake 1 outtake fan setup. Or even a 3x2 setup if you are ok with the AIO pump header. That fan header may be limited in speeds or main run only at full speed but the option is there. 4 internal USB connectors. 2 are USB 2.0 and 2 are USB 3.2 gen 1 (USB 3.0 is what that actually means USB naming is fucked right now). This superior to  the ATX B550 Pro4 version of this mobo that costs more money.RGB support is great. 2 12v RGB connectors and 2 5v RGB connectors. So you don't need to get $15 dollar 12v to 5v RGB converter for your colored lights. Be warned the RGB software asrock has is ASS. But MSI Mystic light is also ASS. Both RGB software's suck ass. It has 2 m.2 slots and a special m.2 slot for a m.2 wifi card. I'll come back to this later. It has 6 Sata ports just like many ATX boards. No internal USB-C connector so your NZXT h510 Case USB-C port won't work. Well it won't work with most mobos at this price point unless you spend way more money. A tomahawk Max does not have this connector either. Instead of buying a 70 dollar thermally poor case with basically no I/O ports that requires a $190 dollar MOBO to have basic I/O functions (MOBOs cheaper then that use a half power fake USB-C internal port such as the B550 A-Pro see below). Buy better reviewed case with better or about equal thermals and better I/O for your MOBO like the Cooler Master NR 600 Fractal Meshify C P400a Pure Base 500 P350x/P360x Bitfenix Nova Mesh TG or if budget is a concern the venerable and excellent budget Cougar Mx330. There are probably more. Basically don't buy a case with I/O your MOBO can't handle when there are plenty of better options. The NZXT h510 is not even close to as good of a case as this sub thinks.  The Tomahawk Max has only 1 m.2 slot and that slot disables 2 sata ports 1 USB 3.2 gen 1 header no 5v RGB support the same number of fan headers. So the B550m Pro4 handily outperforms the B450 Tomahawk Max here. **Back Panel I/O:** Great. It has multiple types of video connectors display port 1.4 HDMI and VGA but those only matter for APU systems. Except a lot of people on budgets buy really good MOBOs and save money by putting in an APU so there system has strong bones for upgrading later. For now B550 does not support the 3200g and 3400g but if the 4000 series apus ever come out this is a good option.Where it really shines is USB Ports. 6 USB-A ports 4 are USB 3 2 are USB 2. Even better it has USB-C and full power 3.2 gen 2 USB-A port so you can USB-C speeds with USB-A port or with a USB-A to USB-C cable. It also has holes for wifi antennas on the I/O shield. This doesn't matter on the tomahawk because a PCIE wifi card would just come out where the PCIe slot is. But for B550m Pro4 this matters because most people who add WIFI will want to add an M.2 card and antenna set.It only has 3 audio connectorsm Line in Front Speaker Microphone. The tomahawk has 6 connectors but at this price point most users will never need 6. Neither board has a SPDIF connector.The Tomahawk Max has more audio connectors but less USB ports although it does have USB-C and only an outdated DVI video port.In the end B550m Pro4 is a bit better but not as much as the other categories. **Special Features**None to speak of on the B550m Pro4.The Tomahawk max is clearly superior here Bios flashback is a cool feature and amazing at this price point. And it is a useful safety feature.**mATX? in an ATX Case?**So it's time to talk about the elephant in the room. The B550m Pro4 is a micro ATX board. A lot of people have concerns about this. For example someone may have VR head set that needs extra USB-C ports so they buy an add in card and they also need a wifi pcie slot. Buying an ATX MOBO with multiple PCIE slots allows them to keep options like that open. So saying most people don't need it doesn't allay the concerns that people might need it. Most people would rather have their computer have options they *may* never need on the off chance they end up do needing it then close the door completely. Piece of mind is huge. And there hasn't really been an mATX board that has solved this issue until the B550m Pro4.Furthermore many mATX cases aren't that good or reviewers don't bother with them so data is limited (that may change cause of how good this board is). They also have size limitations. A board this good can handle a 2080ti no problem so I want a case that gives a monster GPU like that room to breath. So the safe option is an ATX case but most mATX boards lack the fan headers to get optimal cooling in an ATX case.For example the best b450 mATX board the MSI B450 Mortar Titanium only had 4 sata ports only 3 fan headers and 1 m.2 drive. Sure it had lots of PCIe ports but most would be blocked by a GPU. So how well does the B550m Pro4 solve the mATX issue?First: It has fan case fan headers and 6 total more then many ATX MOBOs. They are sensibly placed and will allow great cooling in even high end cases. Next: What about PCIe slots and expansions? [Here is my board](https://imgur.com/a/QxAvOxZ) with my 3 slot EVGA 2080ti FTW3 one of the largest GPUs on the market. As you can see even with a much bigger GPU then most of your 2070supers and so on we still have access to the PCIE slot for expansion down below. And with the excellent fan headers above we can ensure good airflow even with a PCIE card installed below. Most PCIE cards are small won't block air that badly. Especially if you have good case fan cooling (ie not an NZXT h510).Third: What if I need a WIFI card AND a PCIE card for something else. Well this board has a special m.2 slot specifically for WIFI m.2 modules. Most PCIe WIFI Cards like this the [cheapest wifi 6 PCIe card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB7HSFZ?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) on the market simply have an m.2 slot with one of these cards slotted in. It is actually cheaper to buy the same [intel m.2 module](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Network-AX200-NGWG-NV-AX2002230-Retail/dp/B07ZVYKRW9/ref=pd_lpo_147_t_0/140-8230945-0096723?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07ZVYKRW9&pd_rd_r=a9507dad-28e5-4423-870e-f1a4c5566983&pd_rd_w=q8qyA&pd_rd_wg=cHnbv&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=M5TRM28CX1K9PWXRCDE7&psc=1&refRID=M5TRM28CX1K9PWXRCDE7) and [wifi antennas](https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Pigtail-Wireless-Routers-Repeater/dp/B07R21LN5P/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2PLHBZSDXXZ2I&dchild=1&keywords=wifi+antenna&qid=1597244496&s=electronics&sprefix=wifi+ant%2Celectronics%2C237&sr=1-5) then buy a PCIE card. So those of you looking for WIFI or end up needing wifi you can actually save money here buy using the M.2 wifi slot and still have your PCIE card slot open. And you can buy a PCIE card or cables that add even more PCIE slots if you need them like many SFF people do.Fourth: Aesthetics: This is a big issue for some. mATX boards can look a little weird in ATX cases. They may have a bit of dangle wires because the cable management ports on your PSU shroud are a few inches away from the bottom of the board so wires are ran across the case a bit. Or some people just like their board to touch the PSU shroud. And there isn't good answer to this. Aesthetics can be important so maybe the solution here is buy a good mATX case. Hopefully the popularity of this board takes off like the Tomahawk Max and we start getting better mATX options and better case reviews of mATX cases. If everyone is buying this board then maybe we can force GNs hand for mATX case reviews.**To conclude this section:** The B550m Pro4 is an absolute beast of a MOBO for 115 dollars. It can run in an ATX with better fan support then a Gigabyte x570 elite it has good expansion options good VRMs that can OC an 8 core and run a 3900x and likely a 3950x at stock. It has excellent internal connectors and back panel I/O. It's audio codec is on the high end with decent implementation. I believe this board is the best B450 Tomahawk Max killer on the market right now. **So what about all the other options and what to do if this board sells out:**The B550m POro4 board has been selling out regularly people in the know are buying it up in droves. I have even mentioned this board before in posts that have hit the front page and seen this board sell out later that day. Since we have established features in the above discussuins that are baseline. So I'm going to focus primarily on the differences of these boards.**Option 2:****Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 MSRP $115****Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 AC (WIFI) MSRP $125****B550 Pro4 ATX MSRP $135**We need to cover these first. As these boards are similar and similarly priced. These have same LAN chip and audio codec as the B550m Pro4. VRMs: EDIT2: Now we have [accurate VRM data](https://youtu.be/wuPH9pCCK-E?t=656). The what I said below is pretty accurate since the VRMs on the Pro4 run close 50 on a oced 3700x the worse heatsink should not take the Phantom Gaming 4 out of tomahawk VRMs tiers. A 3950x I would recommend a well ventilated case with at least 3 case fans but even then it should be fine.The Pro 4 has a slightly smaller VRM heatsink and the Asrock Phantom Gaming 4 has a weaker heastsink. I cannot find good data on the weaker heatsinks of the PG4 models. However I am keeping an eye out. My take is that the heatsink is less important then the actual components. My belief is the these VRMs punch higher then expected and once we get good VRM testing they will impress. So if thermal testing shows that a 3700x runs at 55c well it might run at 70c with the shittier heatsinks on the PG4 and that would still be ok for Tomahawk tier. I can't guarantee that but if say hardware unboxed gets off there ass and actually tests this thing then if it is near the top of their charts then we can infer that the crappier heatsinks will still be Tomahawk tier VRMs. But if they do run hot like 75 baseline then these VRMs would not quite be tomahawk tier with the worse heatsinkFor now based on my data these are fine and should be Tomahawk Tier even with worse heatsink. This B550 PG4 has the same heatsink and VRMs as the X570 Phantom Gaming 4S for your reference but the x570 Phantom Gaming 4 non S has better VRMs and heatsink.I/O: All of theses boards have worse I/O and internal Connectors. I/O wise The PG4 and PG4 AC (wifi) have no USB-C and only an HDMI port. The B550 Pro 4 ATX board has 5 USB ports no display port but it does have USB-C and full power USB-A port. Internal Connectors: Are worse also as all these boards lack the second USB 3.2 gen 1 (USB 3.0) internal connector so if your case needs 4 USB 3.0 ports these boards can't do that. 95% of cases don't need that but it's worth noting. Special Features. No Bios Flashback But the Phantom Gaming 4 AC has WIFI. The WIFI Module on the is lower end model limited to 433 MBPS Bluetooth 4.2 but it is there for not that much more. So all around these boards are bit worse then the B550 pro4. But they are still competitive with or outperform the B450 Tomahawk Max unless you need USB C in the case of the PG4 models. If the mATX B550m Pro4 is sold out the PG4 boards are solid options. Or if you just want ATX cause you think it looks better These are acceptable.The B550 pro4 is a ripoff at $135 but it recently was on sale for $125 while it is still slightly worse then B550m Pro4 at 125 for ATX it's still better then a Tomahawk Max. **Option 3: B550m Aorus Pro MSRP $130**Another great Tomahawk killer.VRMs: EDIT2: [Turns out these were a little worse then expected](https://youtu.be/wuPH9pCCK-E?t=656). Still close enough to a Tomahawk Max and can run a 3950x at stock although toasty ventilated case and at least 3 case fans is a must here. Are good. Buildzoid says they are better then the B550m pro4 but will run hot so I am waiting for real world testing. That does indicate that they are at least Tomahawk Max class if not better. VRM testing will be huge for this board but I think they are at least Tomahawk max tier. Featureset: LAN chip is the same as the b450 Tomahawk max and B550m Pro4.Audio: Same Realtek 1200 codec as the B550m Pro4. Internal Connectors: Better then a B550m Pro4 in some ways worse in others. You do lose one USB 3.2 gen 1 (USB 3.0) internal connector you lose the wifi specific m.2 port but you can add Thunderbolt 3 header with a 60 dollar add in card. This to my knowledge is cheapest way yet to add thunderbolt 3. This is actually a great thing for those of you switching from Apple audio engineering and need a thunderbolt port on a budget. it only has 3 fan headers though so keep that in mind. Back Panel I/O: Much better. 9 USB Ports USB-C 5 Audio Jacks Spdif connector. Also better built in I/O shield.Special features: Bios Flashback also called Q-Flash. Again CPUless BIOS updating here. This is an excellent option and a decent upgrade from B550m Pro4 and Tomahawk Max. Note the places where it is weaker. Keep a watch out VRM data if this thing is notably better then a B550m Pro4 VRM wise then we get an great upgrade. If the VRMs are equal or even slightly worse it's a decent upgrade especially for people who can make use of the SPDIF port thunderbolt 3 header or or USB ports. These are the best B550 Tomahawk Max Killer boards on the market.**Other boards**So now let's look at some other boards people will ask about but I don't consider Tomahawk Killers unless the price drops or I just don't feel they compete or maybe lack data on:**MSI B550-A PRO MSRP $140**I disagree with hardware unboxed heavily that this is a tomahawk max killer. It is too expensive and low end x570 out competes it. **VRMs:** these are great and will struggle overclocking a bit with a 3950x but can handle a 3900x overclocked like a dream. Excellent overclocker. The issue I have is most people buying at the B450 Tomahawk Max price point of $115 are buying for value not overclocking. Over 90% of pc builders never overclock so for the people who are buying PCs because building is cheaper and they don't plan to overclock those people don't need these VRMs. Overclockers will find a lot to love here.**LAN Chip:** same as the Tomahawk Max and B550m Pro4. **Audio:** same as Tomahawk realtek 892 so worse then the B550m Pro4 and Gigabyte B550m Aorus Pro. **Internal Connectors:** Lacks m.2 wifi port the B550m Pro4 has. Has one less USB 3.2 gen 1 (USB 3.0) internal connector. But it has lots of RGB options. It also has a very interesting feature. A half power USB-C internal connector. So it is not true USB-C speeds or power but only usb 3.2 gen 1 (aka usb 3.0 again USB naming is fucked ) but with a USB-C connector so that means the USB C on your NZXT h510 will not be true USB-C with 10 GBPS speeds and USB-C power delivery. However this board does have true USB-C with max speeds and everything on the back panel I/O.What this means for you is that the USB-C port on your case will work but some devices that require maximum USB-C power will need to plugged into the back of your MOBO. IMHO this is a pretty good thing. Some functionality is better then none.True internal USB-C support for Case USB-C connectors only appears on $200 mobos.So IMHO this is not better then the B550m pro4 or Aorus pro just different but it is better then a Tomahawk Max.Back Panel I/O:** Better then a Tomahawk Max 6 USB-A Ports USB-C and USB A Gen2 ports. 6 Audio jacks no SPDIF. The Audio jacks make it slightly better then a B550m Pro4 but not a Gigabyte B550m Aurous ProSpecial features:Bios Flashback. already discussed. Can fix your borked OC. Also has debug LEDs which cna help trouble shoot issues. The Issue I take with this board is that at $140 you are no longer competing the B450 or even B550 you are competing with x570 now. And now you are in the 140-160 dollar price range where this board is being outcompeted IMHO.And at $140 (keep in mind Covid 19 stock issues messing with pricing pricing is wrecked on these boards) you can get the excellent x570 Phantom Gaming 4 which has superior audio codec a superior high end lan chip thunderbolt 3 support and slightly worse VRMs that are still capable of OCing a 3900x you do lose USB-C. Or you can get the ASUS X570 Prime P for 140 dollars which similar quality VRMs better audio ASUS RGB software which is much better then mystic light. And at 150 dollars we can an Asrock X570 Pro4 which is the same board as the X570 Phantom Gaming 4 but with USB-C. And X570 ASUS TUF non wifi is another good option and that goes on sale for 160 a lot. Also personally I don't think a half power USB-C connector hiding a USB 3.0 port is worth spending $20-25 more for this board just to work with an H510. Buy a better case with better thermals and I/O like a cooler master NR 600 with the better thermals and better I/O and a cheaper MOBO and put that money elsewhere IMHO. You may disagree here. Just like the B550 Pro4 atx version sell this board at $130 and my opinion changes a lot. And there would be a lot of debate do you want the better audio on the B550 Pro4 at 125 or do you want the better VRMs and half power USB-C on the A-Pro for 130. As of now both boards are too expensive.  TLDR: Good featureset excellent VRMs like the board but too expensive compared to the competition and priced in the range of better X570 options.**MSI B550M PRO-VDH WiFi MSRP $130**EDIT 4: I Like this board more. Now that I could sleep on it [it's nicer then I thought](https://old.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/i929fv/mobo_msi_b550m_provdh_wifi_10999_fs/g1cqyiy/). VRMs: EDIT2: Hardware unboxed showed these are very nice VRMs similar to the B550m Pro4.  ~~I haven't seen any data on this boards VRMs. It all comes down to VRMs here. If they are good then this may be a viable option.~~ Lan and audio: Are the same as the B550 Tomahawk Max.Internal connectors: It has the same half power connector as the MSI B550 A-Pro. 5v RGB 2 m.2 slots 4 case fan headers though. Back Panel I/O: No usb C support. Not really different from other board discussed. Special Features: Bios Flashback and 433 mbps WIFI. This board is a clear example of why bother buying an mATX board when an atx board exists. The Asrock Phantom Gaming 4 has a better audio codec similar USB-C support same wifi and is ATX for $5 dollars cheaper. Unless you need Bios flashback this isn't worth buying over the Phantom Gaming 4. Now if it's VRMs are really good and I mean like 3900x overclocked good then maybe but again for $10 you can an x570 Phantom Gaming 4 which is better all around. Bios Flashback is nice but to sacrifice everything else. With accurate VRM data I still don't like this board better then a PG4. It's VRMs aren't so much better and it's lack of true USB-C just isn't compelling. If this board was cheaper I would like. However having said all that I also don't hate it.** Boards not worth discussing in depth at the 100 to 130 price point and a couple others:** **MSI B550m Pro-Dash MSRP $120**Same audio and LAN as the Tomahawk so worse then a B550m Pro4 but no USB-C 5 dollars more then the B550m Pro4 for a mere fake USB-c internal connector and bios flashback. I am paying attention though as this is the best of the bottom sell this at $100 and I perk up a lot depending on the VRM quality. And If the VRMs are near Tomahawk class 105 may be ok. **Gigabyte B550m Elite MSRP: $110**Lowest end Realtor 887 codec no USB-c. Not competitive even if it has solid VRMs if it doesn't hot garbage. **Asus B550 Prime all boards:** Lowest end Realtek 887 audio codec. VRMs suck. **Prime K MSRP $110**Lowest end realtek 887 codec no usb-c. Not competitive even if it has solid VRMs if it doesn't hot garbage. **Prime A/CSM MSRP: $135**Lowest end realtek 887 codec no true usb-c has the half power fake internal connector. Not competitive even if it has solid VRMs if it doesn't hot garbage. Not worth it for half power USB-C fake internal connector.**ASUS PRIME B550M-A WiFi MSRP: $150**Lowest end realtek 887 codec no usb-c. Has blazing fast 2.4 GBPS wifi. Not worth it at that price the x570 Phantom Gaming 4 costs the same has the same wifi and high end audio high end lan chip and thunderbolt 3 support. On top of that the Asrock B550m Pro4 you could add the wifi same module for 28 dollars and it would still be 7 dollars cheaper with USB-C high end audio and just better features. Not worth the money. **ASUS PRIME B550-PLUS MSRP: $150**See all the other Prime boards descriptions no Wifi and add a Thunderbolt header that requires a 60 dollar add in card. For 20 cheaper the gigabyte b550m Aorus pro has this feature and is better all around. **B550 Ds3h.** I was sick of typing at this point with VRM data this thing isn't godawful its bad but it is better then the ASUS primes. It's VRMs run hot for a 3900x at stock. It's lack of fan headers make cooling difficult. I wouldn't run a stock 3900x or 3950x on it. If you are at this budget better to stick with B450 and buy an Asrock B**450**m Pro4 for $75 and then put the 20 into a better component somewhere else. **The Ranking list IMHO** **The Kings:** 1. Asrock B550m Pro4 MSRP: $1152. Gigabyte B550m Aorus Pro MSRP $1303. Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 WIFI MSRP $125 (note no USB-C)4. Asrock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 MSRP $115 (note no USB-c)5. MSI B550 Pro VDH WIFI MSRP: $130 **The also rans that are priced too high IMHO sell these boards a bit cheaper and they become rock solid choices:**5. Asrock B550 Pro4 ATX MSRP: $135 Price it should be: $1256. MSI B550 A-Pro MSRP: $140 Price it should be $130TLDR: I hope you have found a nice B550 board on here that can power your system for years to come."
"So last week my buddy who knows I am into PCs texted me saying that after he upgraded his PSU his computer will no longer post. I tried to fix it for him over text but we couldn't figure it out that way and he brought his computer over. Long story short his new PSU had a 10pin offshoot from the 24pin motherboard cable that needed to be plugged back into the PSU I don't think I've ever seen this before but his PSU was a decent brand so I guess it's w/e.While looking at his PC I said "you know you have the RAM in the wrong slots right?". He told me he did and I figured he knew what I was talking about and said he'd fix it when he got home. For reference he had both sticks in the rightmost 2 slots.The next day after seeing my rig and talking to me about overclocking and stuff he wants to know more. I have him DL CineBench R20 and run a test. He scored pretty low about 2300 which is way below what an 8700k should score. I asked him if his RAM sticks were in the right slots and he admitted he didn't know what those were. I explained and he put the RAM in the correct DIMM slots. Then because he has the same Mobo and CPU as me I sent him a bunch of pictures of my BIOS settings (mostly power settings but also how to enable XMP). He did all that and ran CB20 again.Scored 3425 which is a 25% increase by simply putting his RAM in the correct slots and tweaking some power delivery settings in BIOS.He was shocked at the performance uptick in Tarkov when he went to play it. Our other friend who had a 2060S and 8700k was beating him by 20-30fps on average. Now my buddies 8700k and 2070s system is up 20-30fps average over the other guy.I sent him this [gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3knKct3fGqxhK/giphy.gif) and said my work here is done.Waiting to hear from friend 2 now about tuning.....Edit:Tldr put your ram in the right slots and turn on xmpEdit 2: rip my inbox"

"There are a lot of "is X gpu good?" questions posted and they rarely ever provide any context to answer the question.The answer is simple but it depends on everyone's context so this is my "flowchart" kind of logic to answer the question for your context.First you need to know:- 1) Your monitor specs (resolution Hz)- 2) What kind of games do you play (recent AAA ultra optimised esport games 2D indies from 2015...)- 3) How close do you want to get to maxing out your monitor specs for those games you play - 4) Extra features (RTX stream encoder stuff etc)Now how to find your GPU in 1 step: **go on youtube type "benchmark [the kind of game that you play] at [resolution]"** watch videos and find in the graphs your target fps and this is probably your gpu. **Once you have found the X gpu search for "X benchmark at [resolution]" to double check its performance** on a greater variety of games.Note that for 1080p you will also have to take CPU into account in those results not so much for 1440p not at all for 4k.**Example:** I have a 1440p 144Hz monitor and I want to play recent AAA games at at least 80fps. I type "horizon zero dawn 1440p benchmarks" and I will find videos testing many gpus on HZD at my resolution. Some gpus will give 30fps I don't want those they're too weak I want more fps. Some gpus will give 200fps (doubt any gpu actually does that but it's for the sake of the example) those are too strong I'm wasting money on them I don't need that much fps for my monitor. A bunch will be around my 90 fps target maybe 3 or 4.My GPU is probably one of these 4. Those are probably 2060S 5700XT 2070 and 2070S.Now I want to compare those to understand their differences. I type **"5700XT vs 2070 super 1440p benchmark"**. I check the results for the kind of games I play. I probably want the better performance but I also have to keep price in mind. In this instance the 5700XT probably has equal or marginally better performance for 100$ less on average so I would probably choose 5700XT. Secondary/optional steps: do I care about RTX do I care about streaming do I care about AMD vs nvidia drivers etc.This is my thought process to help you choose your gpu based on your context and needs."
"So a few years ago (circa Ryzen 1700) there were rings of people taking Ryzen processors swapping them for fakes (usually old LGA processors) and returning them with clear labels on them. I had thought that it mostly ended a while back but I just ordered a processor from an online retailer most of us have ordered from and it was first party (not that rando third party crap that is sketchy) and my processor was a fake. When you buy a processor (this occurs in-store and from reputable sellers) be sure to check for a few things:* Examine the security seal closely they should be near perfect and the text near perfect if it is odd then proceed with caution.* Look through the window at the CPU and make sure it looks right. Look at the heat spreader check if it has the same design as the processor should have. Google it and make sure that you dont find dummy models sent to news outlets those have the same designs as the fakes. Find a review with a photo of the CPU in the socket. Make sure it is identical.* While looking through the window see if the markings on the CPU are *on* the CPU or *in* the CPU. I believe both AMD and Intel use laser markings now so you should be able to tell. Look at the edges of the top of the CPU for any lines that could denote a sticker affixed to the top of the CPU. * TAKE PHOTOS IF YOU ARE UNSURE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY!**My Experience** - I purchased a i9-10850KA (yup probably the latest Intel on the market indicating this is still occurring) and when I got it it didn't feel right. The box was messed up but IDC if the processor is fine. But it was really banged up and the security tape was not clear it had oddities in it - so I started taking photos. I looked at the processor and as I havent upgraded in about 4 years It didnt strike me as odd. I opened up the box and grabbed the CPU and thats when I noticed that it appeared there was a sticker on the top and a small defect in the way it was applied. At this point I was 99.9% sure it was a fake so I started looking online for 10850k/10900k CPU's and thats when I saw 1: dummy CPUs have this shape and 2: the real CPU in the socket is all you should be looking for and thats when I noticed mine was a fake. What could this have done if I placed it in my $400 motherboard who knows but it would have absolutely made my return/refund process monumentally more difficult. I got lucky my experience saved my butt but I know a lot of people that post here are brand new so before you bend pins or potentially short a motherboard out... **OPEN YOUR CPU AND EXAMINE IT!**Article about the situation with the 1700x - https://www.pcmag.com/news/fake-amd-ryzen-chips-appear-for-sale-on-amazonebayMy pics - https://imgur.com/a/Z2RxaP7Edit - some of you saw this yesterday but it was removed because I mentioned the retailer I bought it from in the title"
"Like it doesn’t matter what you paid you paid that SEVERAL years ago + it’s USED. Also people who sell used parts and refer to the most expensive retail price. Like no we’re not “saving $30” for a used ryzen the part is used mate you can’t compare it to retail price. I’ve been seeing used 1080s or cards that have been mined on go for just a little under their retail price on the used market. Just infuriates me sometimes"
"Does anyone else think the GPU market is completely unsustainable? And I'm not just talking about 2020 with the whole pandemic worsening the situation. Even before that price inflation was out of control and stock was fairly low on cards thanks to stuff like cryptomining never really going away. It's so bad it's actually making me rethink my decision to upgrade my PC this year and consider a console instead.For example currently I have a 1660S in my system and want to upgrade to an RTX 30 card this year preferably a 3080 but I know I'll never find one any time soon without paying $1000+. By the time RTX 30 cards finally get any sort of decent stock it might be late into 2021 and by then stuff like Super and Ti versions of cards will be released and RTX 40 series cards will be in the pipeline and well on their way. To summarize what I'm saying here it seems like we've hit a point where buying any new GPUs at or near launch is a pipedream and by the time they're actually available they're already outdated and less desirable to buy. The market seems like it's in a very weird/bad place in the last few years obviously worsened by the pandemic situation this year and I don't see it improving for the better any time soon without dramatic change."

"They want me to buy one from Alienware because they have both owned dell computers that they use for work. Dell PCs were pretty good a few years back but now they're some weird OEM motherboard that isn't compatible with half of the stuff on the computer. They think the parts in an Alienware "aren't the foreign ones you get when you build your own" but I'm pretty sure that Alienware PCs have terrible airflow and temps. I know the GPU shortage is still a thing but I'm willing to wait on finding one at msrp than buying a low quality Alienware prebuilt. Gamers Nexus literally did a video roasting Alienware prebuilts! They say that that's just some Mexican guy who is getting paid by a computer company to roast a premium company. That the people who review the parts on pcpartpicker are just bots created by the companies who make the parts. Just to clarify I think all people are equal. I don't stereotype or discriminate anyone no matter their skin color occupation religion national origin sex or gender."
"So I’ve recently bought a big part of my new gaming pc. I went with:- Ryzen 7 5800x- Gigabyte Aorus Master x570- 16GB Crucial Ballistix 3600Mhz- NZXT X73 - 1TB Samsung evo 970 SSD NVMe- 2TB Samsung qvo 860 SSDYesterday I was talking to my dad about the RTX3080 and I really wanted one to complete my build but that they’re out of stock or overpriced by 2-3x right now. He said he hoped they’d drop in price soon or that I’d be able to find one.This morning I went over to get a cup of coffee with him and he told me he ordered the last HP Omen 30L with a RTX3080 built in that was in stock in our county. He explained that he actually wanted a new pc to work with but doesn’t need the GPU. So he said that he knew how much I wanted the 3080 I could have the 3080 in exchange for my old gtx670. I was so dumbfounded and amazed he would do that. Truly great. Hopefully the custom 3080s they use for omen builds will fit normally.So excited!Edit: thanks for all the awards and kind words! Restaurants are opening up here soon and I’m gonna take him out for a nice seafood dinner as it’s what he really likes! Edit2: thanks for all the tips on cases will look into them!Edit3 and final one!First of all thanks again for all the recommendations and kind words. My dad and I built my new pc together and that was a lot of fun. In the end I went for the Corsair 5000D Airflow case. I also chose to go with RGB and it’s more fun than I originally thought. The RTX3080 from the Omen PC was perfectly interchangeable and I ended up getting a nice Logitech MX mouse/keyboard set he really wanted and a GTX1080 for my dad it fitted in the case with I’m not kidding 1mm spare room. The omen didn’t even have seals so for anyone thinking about doing the same no warranty issues when you open the case. After every built it we ended up discovering that the motherboard was dead.. so had to replace it and now it works like a charm. Still very grateful [Omen](https://i.postimg.cc/pdRDymBH/2-A7261-B5-FE2-A-4818-9-A42-6-DF342-D1-F3-F7.jpg) [Size difference ](https://i.postimg.cc/LsDjPmyZ/A6-B68239-2217-4-A92-AED0-12-E968-FEDAEE.jpg) [New PC](https://i.postimg.cc/YCcNKnGj/ABEB782-F-D09-D-4-DFB-8-EFD-3-ABFB1-ED6570.jpg)"
"Yup. Went to take my stock Wraith Prism off my 2700x pulled the CPU right off and bent the pins. Then broke a few off trying to bend them back. Good as any time to upgrade right? Oh wait 5000-series are sold out. I decided to go with a 3900x. It's cheaper than a 5600x + new motherboard.Moral of the story? Be careful when removing stock CPU cooler."

"Is it possible to get the RGB in your PC to change color depending on your heart rate? So when it's low it'd start cool (Purple>Blue) and as your heart rate elevates it'd start to warm up until it's (Orange>Red) when you're really amped up. You'd obviously need some way to track your heart rate but I imagine a smart watched connected via Bluetooth to the PC would work... maybe? Just thought it'd be cool like legit mood lighting."
"I've been in IT for a long time. I've moved into the enterprise space working mostly for larger companies.  I'll freely admit that this has left me jaded and frankly has nearly killed the joy I found on the hobbyist side of computers.After a long day in the trenches trudging through data centers and meeting with clients the last thing I want to do is work on a computer. I just feel like I've been there done that. The joy was gone.Hell I don't even personally own a PC. With the exception of a phone anything I use is either company or family owned.I even game (gasp) on a freaking console.But that recently changed. My 14 year old son asked me to help him build a gaming PC.**Holy shit** this has been amazing. We talked about what he wanted to play (Minecraft Space Engineers Titanfall 2 and Apex). We researched Cases CPUs video cards motherboards and RAM. We looked at benchmarks bad YouTube videos and read reviews.We spent tons of time together where I wasn't just dumb ol' dad.So after us planning he started saving doing extra chores and working odd jobs for the neighbors he finally had enough to get his system. He handed me the money and told me to order the parts.Things came in over the course of several days and we spent the evenings putting his "beast" together. My job was to point and explain. We got it all together and he asked me to show him how to clean up the cables. Velcro and zip-ties were our friend.We had some issues with the motherboard BIOS version and the CPU but AMD came through with a CPU kit. The best part is that he learned some basic troubleshooting and how to write to vendors.We finally finished putting it together installed the OS and such and then tried a few games.Honestly this was the best time I've had putting a machine together ***ever***. Even my own gaming rigs weren't this much fun.I forgot why I loved this field. My son just helped me remember. I can't thank him enough.**Specs (because we are all nerds at heart):**  WaterSquare 5 ATX Case  Ryzen 5 3600  Gigabyte Aorus B450 Pro WiFi  Sapphire Pulse RX590  Corsair Vegence Pro 16GB 3200 DDR4 with Silly Lights  Crucial MX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA M.2  EVGA GS 550 Gold  5x 120mm RGB fans  PICTEK RGB Mouse and Keyboard  RGB LED MousepadNow I need to build one for me so we can play together.

"Here I am building my first PC and I decided to put in my cpu (Ryzen 7 3700x) and it all goals fairly well yada yada and I put my heat sink on top of it and it looks beautiful. My OCD kicks in and i think to myself “hmmm it could be more straight” I proceed to yank the heat sink off and notice that on the bottom of my heat sink is my cpu. I basically broke every single pin 😂 Live and learn my friends."
"I've been debating if I should make the switch and today I finally did. 2 words: holy shit.The difference is huge. I don't know how I used to play on 1080p. I have a 3060ti and now I feel I wasted money playing 1080p on my 3060ti. Just wow. Just as an eye test whenever I am in game I switch to 1080p and back to 1440p to see the difference. I used to play games with a flu (blurry) image lol. The difference is huge at least to me. Now I am trying to image what 4k would look like but obviously I would need a way better GPU. To whoever is contemplating to make the switch contemplate no more do it it's worth every dollarEdit: forgot to mention. I'm at 165hz. Also I went from 27inch 1080p to 27 inch 1440p.Edit 2: for those wondering i got the Asus VG27WQ.Edit 3: so i learned smth new. Setting my 1440p monitor to 1080p isn't a fair comparison didn't know that! Regardless I definitely see a difference between my old 1080p and my new 1440p.Also for those wondering i didn't do much testing yet but I played a few games yesterday. I get a solid 55 FPS on Flight Simulator 2020 ultra settings. 100-110 FPS on warzone full settings. I have the ROG Strix 3060ti OC which is probably a bit more powerful than other 3060ti'sAlso didn't expect all the love/awards! Thanks guys!! Hopefully my post was helpful to some!Edit 4: guys and girls I already edited this post in Edit 3 saying that setting my 1440p monitor to 1080p is NOT a fair comparison."
"Hello friends today I'd like to talk about an aspect of our glorious systems that get overlooked a lot: our audio experience on our battlestations. Thanks to /u/paoper for formatting. Again disclaimer that I am an idiot so take this post with a grain of salt. Better info and more accurate info from people way more knowledgeable than I am is readily available from /r/audiophile /r/budgetaudiophile and /r/headphones this is just a start-up guide for the beginner.NOTE: The monster I gave birth to has become too long. I felt that instead of a short list of things to order I needed to give context as high fidelity is really all about what sound is like in *your* experience. Also a fun read if you are interested. Feel free to skip to the actual list (ctrl+f active speakers passive speakers headphones subwoofer amplifier)! I have limited the price range of the products because this is after all just food for thought and not even a proper guide; real audio purchases will require elbow-grease and research from your end to see if the product's sound signature will match your preferences in music and sound. I am an audiophile of the musician background I know what instruments sound like and have a decently trained ear (insert usual audiophile shenanigans).## So wtf is this?So occasionally while answering questions on this subreddit (mainly on why new builder's systems aren't posting or what components they should get or just mourning with fellow builders for systems that have passed on as well as celebrating the birth of new systems and fellow pc builders who take their rite of passage of building their own system with their own two hands) I would come across the occasional "what speakers/headphones are best under $xx" and with the state of pc products being "gaming rgb ultimate series XLR" or w/e it's hard to discern what audio products are actually worth your money. Note that if you are using just "good enough" cheap speakers any of the speakers/headphones on this list will blow your mind away. Get ready to enter a new world of audio.## Why should I bother getting better speakers/headphones?I have owned $20 logitech speakers I currently own $1500 speakers. I have owned varying levels of headphones. The first half-decent (to my standards) speakers I had was a hand me down stereo set from an uncle. This thing was massive but this thing was good. It's difficult to explain to you the sensation of music enveloping you with great speakers. Speakers are meant to reproduce sound as in the sound of the instruments in the song. So great speakers and headphones can literally make you FEEL the music like at a rave or a concert or performance in the comfort of your home. This is why Home Theaters were so popular in the 80s/90s.# General considerations (or feel free to just skip ahead to the list)Now I totally understand using simple logitech speakers due to budget/space/easy-access from best buy or not knowing about the wider audio world. So I am here today to give you a perspective on what audio components are TRULY worth your hard-earned cash. I have owned $20 logitech speakers in college I have owned guitar amps as well as studio monitors/other speakers ranging from $100-$1500. Do know that all of this information is readily available in /r/BudgetAudiophile /r/audiophile and /r/headphones . I am merely condensing all of it into a single list and attempt to sort of explain it to the pc builders or just an idiot rambling.If you would like more information on specific speakers I would check out reviewers on youtube like zerofidelity steve guttenberg nextbigthing (nbt) studios and thomas and stereo. For headphones metal751 innerfidelity Ishca's written reviews DMS.Z reviews is good as he gives the most coverage on different audio equipment though his style of reviews leave much to be desired and I mainly watch him for gear coverage or for entertainment.Also with speakers speaker placement is extremely important. Get those speakers off your desk and the woofers/tweeters to your ear level NO MATTER THE COST. Stack boxes/books buy speaker stands/isolation pads from amazon at worst buy yoga blocks from amazon. Put your speakers on them get ready for even better audio.Now this list is just simple guide. Obviously for $300 budget theres probably like 10 different speakers to choose from. You will catch me repeat this many many times but sound is subjective I don't know what genres of music you enjoy and what sound signatures in headphones/speakers you would prefer (warm sounds? bright? aggressively forward? laid back sound signature? importance of clarity vs bass?) So consider this list with a grain of salt as this is after all the ramblings of an idiot on reddit.## CategoriesSo I will be splitting this list into 4 categories: - dacs- active speakers- passive speakers- amplifiers- headphonesAnd before I start bass depth and low end does not fucking equal bad boomy bass. I absolutely detest low quality boomy bass like in Beats headphones and general "gaming speakers" or w/e. Also the budetaudiophile starter package is the dayton audio b652 + mini amp combo from parts-express. All the speakers that were considered were basically compared to the b652 before making it on here (and whether they justified the price bump over the b652)##DACsA DAC is a digital to analogue converter. Your music/sound coming from your pc is a digital signal which is then converted to analogue so that the signal can reach your speakers/headphones. DACs are built into any device that has a 3.5mm output (your pc ipod smartphone etc). The general consensus is that modern DACs have come a very far way that even budget dacs sound great and clean. Your audio chain will go pc -> dac (via USB or optical) -> amp (via rca cables) -> speakers (via speaker wire to 5-way binding posts or banana plugs)/headphones.- Schiit Fulla (dac/amp combo) $100 - The schiit fulla is a decent dac/amp combo that has a mic input for headsets. They definitely went for the gaming headset market. Back in the 2010 days the schiit fulla and the e10k were the only things being recommended on reddit but audio tech has advanced and now there are better options at the same price range.- Fiio K3 $100 (dac/amp) : the k3 is a great budget option if you have $100 in your budget but would like both a dac and a headphone amp. Really not much to say. Get the schiit fulla if you really need that mic input else get the K3.- JDS Atom Dac $100 - a popular dac primarily due to the fact that the JDS Atom amp is probably the most recommended amp as it has the best objective performance and measurements out of the $100 amplifiers and many people tend to buy the corresponding dac to their amplifier for the stack. The atom dac is a no bullshit dac measures well and is a solid buy for $100.- Topping E30 $130 - When the topping e30 came out I was genuinely surprised at how good dacs had come in recent years for so cheap. For $130 you're getting performance that used to be locked away behind the $3-400 price gate. Probably the best "bang for buck" dac on this list as well as part of my active setup.- Fiio K5 Pro (Dac/headphone Amp combo) $150 - This is the best option for if you just want a good amp and a dac without shelling out too much. I personally had the k5 pro for a month and usually with dac/amp combos the maufacturer will usually skimp out on either the dac or the amp if in the budget pricepoint. One example is the ifi zen dac/amp; same price as the k5 pro but if I had to split up the $150 on the dac and amp section the ifi zen would have $100 spent on the dac and $50 on the amp. However the K5 Pro has split evenly $75 on each section. The amp has plenty of clean power while the dac is also sufficient. Great budget option.- IFI ZEN (dac/headphone amp) $150 - an alternative to the k5 pro. The dac on this unit is objectively better than the k5 pro and sounds cleaner however the amplifier leaves much to be desired as it lacks power.  I would personally rather have more power on the k5 pro but the ifi zen is no slouch either the dac is quite good.- SMSL AD18 (dac/speaker amp) $150 - a great budget dac/amp for speakers that also offers a subwoofer out and bluetooth 2 rare features in this price bracket. This little unit has enough clean power for nearfield speakers and features usb 3.5mm coaxal optical and bluetooth connections though bluetooth will be limited to aptx codec. Features a headphone amp that is a side show so is quite weak. For $150 you get a dac headphone amp and a speaker amp with bluetooth. Great value for $150 if you're looking to fill all 3 roles.- Schiit magnius $200 - a very recent release this is Schiit's attempt at correcting the flaws of the magni. The magnius like the e30 is another dac that has benefited from the massive improvements in audio technology at budget price bracket in the past couple years. Offers the usual connections but also has balanced XLR input/output (if you don't know what this means feel free to ignore as balanced will only add to your audio chain cost) This dac is probably the new standard to beat for under $500 dacs. ## Active vs. Passive (crude explanation)So when a speaker plays music from your pc the audio is processed by the audio card on your motherboard which is then sent to the amplifier where the signal is amplified and then finally is sent to be played on your speakers. Active speakers like logitech speakers that have a power cable running from the speakers directly to the wall socket have built-in amplifiers to power the speakers whereas passive speakers require a separate amplifier to amplify the audio signal and feed the speakers power. Active vs passive no real difference as both types of speakers will have good audio quality depending on how they are made and which ones you buy but in the ultra budget section of speakers (under $300) actives tend to be cheaper than their passive counter parts. This is due to the manufacturer cutting corners elsewhere.Now generally speakers should be recommended based on your music/audio preferences and tastes as speakers and in a larger part speaker brands will have their own unique sound signatures that some will love and others will hate as sound is such a subjective experience. But since this is meant to cater to a wide audience note that my list is not the ALL inclusive and again is only the ramblings of an idiot.# ACTIVE SPEAKERSSimply connect to your PC or TV via 3.5mm (or the occasional usb).Note: you may experience a hissing with active speakers that may annoy you to no end even up to the $400 mark. This is a result of the amplifier being built in to the speaker in close proximity as well as sometimes the manufacturer cutting corners elsewhere. Passive speakers do not have this unless you buy a really shitty amp. Note that while bigger woofer size does not necessarily indicate better quality/bass this does more often than not seem to be the case as manufacturers put bigger woofers on the higher stepup model.Note that while I have included 2.1 systems here I would always recommend you get good bookshelves first save up money and buy a subwoofer separate.## Example options- Cyber Acoustics CA-3602FFP 2.1 $40. This is the I'm broke af but I need speakers route. 2.1 setup for 40 bucks. We do not have the luxury of options here. Enough said. Amazon- Okay for under $100 for good quality active speakers there really is no other choice here besides Edifier speakers on amazon. In fact their entire lineup is pretty solid all around ranging from the 980T for $70 to the S350DB which is a 2.1 system with 2 bookshelves and a sub for $300. Differences in the models are basically bigger woofers/tweeters as you go up in price resulting in better bass performance and clarity (again crude explanation). If you don't want to research much and want simplicity any of the edifiers are the way to go with the 1700BT being the goto 2.0 or the 1850db which as a sub-out so you can add in a subwoofer into your setup later.- Micca PB42X: $120- The active version of the popular MB42X passive speakers. Very good performance for price.- Mackie CR3/4 $90/$140- Now normally I don't recommend these but they are okay/meh speakers and have that razer aesthetic going on and aesthetics are big part of speaker choice so if you like the black/green color scheme I guess these are passable.- Klipsch Pro Media 2.1: $150- the only 2.1 system I'd recommend under $200. The thing about adding in a subwoofer to a 2.1 system under $200 means they have to cut corners elsewhere. This is the main difference of 2.1 systems vs bookshelves. While the subwoofer will allow your music to hit the lower notes in frequency resulting in deeper and more bass this will usually come at a cost of audio quality in the mid and upper ranges in the music. If you are a BASSHEAD then yeah you probably want a subwoofer though bookshelves under $200 also have decent bass. Note ALWAYS BETTER TO BUY BOOKSHELVES AND SUBWOOFER SEPARATELY but this will be pricier. Klipsch Website Direct or amazon.- Fluance ai40/ai60: $200/$300- nice looking speakers that come in white and walnut and black that also have good clarity and quality. Their bass is surprisingly okay as they are rated to go a little bit below in the lower frequencies than speakers in similar price. I have listened to these before shortly for 2 hours and would recommend. IIRC the ai60 has a subwoofer out. Mind the size of the 60s quite big. Fluance direct or amazon.- Kanto YU4: $270 Direct competitor to fluance ai series. Comes in white as well.- Audioengine A2+/A5+ :$270/$400. I have no experience with this lineup but lots of love/hate dynamic with this brand over on budgetaudiophile. Good and bad thing.- JBL 305P: $300 - maybe the endgame speakers of this list. These are very famous and respected studio monitors that music artists and producers use often. They are sold $150 per speaker and you will need to get 2. Hooking them up requires separate cables as these are standalone speakers with it's own volume control on **each speaker**. Simplest way is to buy a 3.5mm to dual TS Cable. Set both speakers to same physical volume level via knob and adjust volume using windows settings (having a volume knob on your keyboard helps immensely here). Or buy a separate in line volume control from amazon ($20 bucks or under) and connect via 3.5mm to rca. Being studio monitors these are meant to reproduce sound neutrally (they will have no external flavoring like how Beats adds muddy boomy bass to its headphones to use as a bad example) and may not sound alive or bright or to your tastes. They can be demo-ed/tested out at guitar center if you have access to one in this pandemic.- Logitech G560 RGB Gaming Speakers: $200 (yes you read that right): Okay now normally I'd be crucified for recommending a logitech speaker in the other audio forums. But I have used these speakers briefly for about 3 months when I got them cheap from a friend. The sound quality of these satellite speakers are....surprisingly not bad? Might I dare to say that these are even....decent for it's price? Now these are $200 speakers for a 2.1 system. This means that it's either this or Klipsch 2.1. Honestly my vote here goes to the logitechs. I owned the Klipsch promedia 2.1 for about half a year. I can definitely say I prefer the clarity of the logitechs vs the boomy bass of the Klipsch. The subwoofer on the 560 does NOT have its own control knob so you would need to adjust bass settings through logitech eq. Note these speakers will not sound good out of the box. You will need to go into the eq settings via logitech software and change the settings to match your tastes. Honestly the fact that you have to tweak the eq through shitty logitech software to make these sound good is pretty bullshit. Note that I am not recommending the z623/625. Don't get those. I used these in college in my apt in brooklyn and while boomy bass I'd definitely go with the B652 + mini amp klipsch 2.1 or the g560 over the z623/625 FOR SURE.- Second-hand market: okay let's say you are determined to get quality speakers but you do not have the budget. Look around on the second hand market for stuff from KRK Emotiva Ascend HSU. Make sure to demo them out for as long as you can until the seller gets pissed (please don't) so that you can test to see if you like the sound.# PASSIVE SPEAKERSThese speakers will require you to buy a separate amplifier as well as separate cables. But the passive route allows you to have a modular audio system that allows you to upgrade parts as you go along in your life (yes I said life for once you dip your toes into high fidelity you will get hooked onto a great lifelong journey searching for the perfect setup) or even just add parts in altogether (like having a miniamp on your desk for your passive speakers having a separate dac or bluetooth module for your speakers so you can connect the passive speakers via USB or bluetooth wirelessly stacked on top of a headphone dac/amp combo stacked on top of a preamp etc). Amplifier list to follow later.Passive speaker specs to pay attention to will be their impedance (measured in ohms) and their sensitivity (measured in xx db/1w/1m). Speaker ratings in wattage are measurements of how much power can be driven to them (higher watts higher volume...once again crude explanation). A 20 watt x 2 channel amp (measured in 4 ohms) is enough to power 4 and 6 ohm speakers rated at 100 watts to moderate/decently loud listening levels on your desktop. Now the sensitivity thing. A speaker with a rating of 85db/1m/1w means it will produce 85 decibels of noise at 1 meter with 1 watt of power. Now this not linear....to make the same speaker go up to 90 decibels may require 10 or 15 watts of power depending on other variables. Depending on how loudly you play your music and what impedance/sensitivity your speakers have will result in your choice of amplifiers. More on this later.The thing about passive bookshelf speakers are that you can use them in your desktop setup AND with your TV as a legitimate starter 2.1 home theater setup (which you can upgrade to 3.1 and then 5.1/5.2 just buy a used receiver from craigslist for 50 bucks ez)## What you will need for passive setup:Note that passive speakers and amp require you to purchase [speaker wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LW0WDQ/) separately (fairly cheap) and strip them (youtube video will guide you very easy). Or if you like clean cable management and easy setups [banana plug cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FKJDTPY/) from amazon will set you straight and while these banana plugs and cable are nice and PURELY OPTIONAL they will add up in cost as your buy more of them for frankenstein 2.1 cabling. Also a [3.5mm to rca cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D5H8KO2/) will be required. The connection will be your pc -> 3.5mm->rca->amp->speaker wire-> speaker wire->speaker. (replace speaker wire with banana plug if going that route). Subwoofer connection will be explained in subwoofer section.## Example options- Dayton audio b652+ mini amp combo on parts-express for $60/70. Two combos two separate mini amps one from lepai (china) and one from dayton. Same shit. It **LITERALLY** does not get better than this for under $100 maybe even $150. CHIEF THIS IS IT i cannot stress this enough. This is the budgetaudiophile 101 starter pack. I'd recommend these over the active Mackies Edifiers (up to the 1700) and any and all logitech/creative pebble/cyber w/e EVERYTHING systems (except for the g560). These are very BIG speakers and hence will deliver good sound and good bass due to its big woofers. If you have less than $100 to spend on the ENTIRE audio setup go get these and speaker wire/banana plugs no questions asked. gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo- Dayton Audio B652 AIR $70- The difference between the AIR and the normal 652 is in the tweeter. The AIR tweeter on this speaker costs as much as the entire b652 speaker. This tweeter upgrade gives even more clarity and quality in the treble range (middle upper sound frequency). The next best thing for under $100 though doesn't come with the mini amp combo.- Sony SSCS5 Bookshelf Speakers. $150 msrp $120 on amazon/bestbuy until recently and sometimes goes on sale for $75. These are 3 way speakers with woofer tweeter and supertweeter. The strength of these speakers lie in its unmatched clarity in the highs and upper mids. I still have these in my collection and VERY WORTH though my opinion of these is skewed as I got them for $75/pair. If you appreciate bass you will need to add a subwoofer with these (or generally any speaker below $500....some people would say you cant listen to music on bookshelves without subwoofer) as they sound a bit thin compare to the b652s (a bit less bass because smaller woofer) but better sound quality (though this is just my SUBJECTIVE thought after listening to the cs5s and b652s). These have 5 in woofers and have okayish small form factor.- Micca MB42X $90- the passive version of the powered PB42X in the active list. The difference is between the amplifier built into the PB42X vs the one you're going to buy separately to power the MB42X. Obv the MB42X route is going to be better because the amplifier in the PB42X will be shit compared to the one you're going to buy ($30/50/75/150 options to follow later)- Micca RB42X $150 - Amazing small size speakers. For under $200 either this or the cs5s. The rb42s have a bit more bass.- Elac Debut 5.2/6.2 $280/350. These are speakers highly acclaimed by many of the speaker reviewers I consider the best (imo zerofidelity steve guttenberg nextbigthing (nbt) studio thomas and stereo). Great bass warm sound signature. Just go what are you waiting for. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO- Q Acoustics 3020/3030i $230/400. Highly acclaimed by reviewers look VERY NICE in white and have a warm sound signature with lots of bass clarity and bass depth. These speakers are big which is why they have great bass. Check the dimensions. Their size is the only downside to these fantastic speakers.- PSB Alpha P5 $400: Great speakers for nearfield listening aka at your desk excels in this department more so than the other speakers (better at low volume etc). Just all around amazing. Get these if the Q Acoustics ones are too big.- Triangle BR02/03 $450/550. Coming from across the atlantic these french speakers made a splash last year destroying its competition in the below $1000 range. Highly acclaimed to the point where some see them as overrated (too much hype out of nowhere in such little time). If you have the space in your setup as well as in your wallet for these they are the way to go. Comes in black walnut white.- Obligatory Klipsch R15/R51/RP600 post: you've heard of klipsch. They're widely available audiophile speakers and so sometimes get the "overrated" hyped up treatment. They are good speakers but their have their own unique aggressively forward sound signature with the horn style tweeter. These were designed to make you feel like you're at the rock concert direct may not be for everyone (much so not for me).# AMPLIFIERSActive speakers have built-in amplifiers so they are exempt. But passive speakers will require separate amps and so you will need to pay attention to certain specs. In speakers you will need to pay attention to their impedance (measured in ohms) and their sensitivity (measured in xx db/1m/1w). Take for instance the popular SMSL SA50. This is an amp that delivers 50 watts to its 2 channels rated at 4 ohms. Speakers will have impedance of 4 6 or 8 ohms usually. 50 watts at 4 ohms can be 25 watts at 8 ohms but is probably more like 20 watts at 8 ohms refer to product specs for specific wattage ratings at specific ohms. Speakers with high sensitivity (85-95 db/1w/1m) that have 6 ohm impedance are easier to drive with lower wattage.But here's the thing an the smsl sa50 will not deliver 50 CLEAN watts. Somewhere in the 30-40w range distortion will start to appear. But for reference 30 clean watts is enough to drive sony cs5s to uncomfortably loud levels in an apartment (the whole apt not just your room) so listening on your desktop you only really need 10-15 clean watts (only after turning up your preamp input to maximum volume which in this case is your youtube/windows10 volume level). Do note that if you have the space a used $60 AV Receiver that will just shit out watts and have 5.1 surround will be the best but these things are massive.## Speaker Amps- Lepai 2020ti (LEPAI and not Lepy be wary) $25. 20 watts in 2 channels. Budget- SMSL SA36 $62: SMSL's 2x20w.- SMSL SA50 $72: The most bang for buck amp that's also decent. 2x50watts.- Topping MX3 $130: Speaker amp headphone amp dac rolled into one. Allows for your speakers and headphones to be connected via USB and Bluetooth.- SMSL DA-8S $170: A great amp with LOTS of clean power for nearfield listening. I have one powering my canton ventos and out of 60 volume I literally max out at 35 before it gets waaaay too loud. This thing has a ton of clean power and operates at very cool temps (literally never approaches warm). Highly recommend. Honestly before this unit and the SMSL SA300 there really was no speaker amp that had a small enough form factor without sacrificing on power output or in total harmonic distortion while NOT breaking your wallet.## Headphone Amps- Fiio e10k $75: The cheapest one I'd recommend- SMSL M3 $85: A solid budget headphone amp. Nothin else to be said. If you're strapped on cash you'll buy the e10k but if you have more cash you will certainly buy the JDS Atom. This one has an awkward price but I would personally get this over the e10k.- JDS Labs Atom $100: Heralded by many as the budget standard amp. This thing is $100 and has 1 W of clean power @ 32 ohms and was heralded by many as the king of under $300 which is no longer true. The only downside to this unit is the build quality. Upon it's release there was nothing better in the $100 range but that has changed. Now this is just a plastic construction amp that has clean power. Still a great amp but personally I would rather get the Topping l30 for better construction and headphone/preout/off switch.- Topping l30 $140: A pretty much state-of-the-art headphone amp from topping. It has enough watts to power most headphones very cleanly and adds no coloration to the sound. Comes in a nice metal chassis and personally I see the l30 as the king of budget amps. Also the front headphone/preout/off switch is a godsend for people with speaker+headphone setup at their desk. Part of my active setup.- Schiit Magnius $200: state-of-the-art amp from Schiit. This is probably the new standard for under $500 amps as it offers 2 w single-ended 5w balanced @ 32 ohms. Lots of clean power and offers balanced input/output. I highly recommend this. - Rupert Neve RNHP $500: This is the cheapest headphone amp you can buy that is from the renowned rupert neve. This is an amazing amplifier with great amounts of clean power and is the only amp that I would describe as having a very organic sound with great timbre. If you're ready to spend this amount of money on just 1 peace of gear in your audio chain this surely requires more research from your end.# SUBWOOFERSGood subwoofers are expensive and cheap subwoofers will hurt your listening experience rather than improve it (muddy boomy shitty bass). Your best bet may be to simply find a used subwoofer from craigslist or offerup ***just dont get the polk audio PSW10*** this is a very common sub you see on the 2nd hand market because it is a shitty sub and so people get rid of it. Now as to whether you need a subwoofer. If you are in a dorm don't get a subwoofer. Because.... if you live in a dorm ***do not get a fucking subwoofer***. Now if you live in a small apartment fear not proper subwoofer management will save you noise complaints. A good subwoofer will produce good quality low end you can hear and feel without having to turn up the volume. You want to look at the subwoofer's lowest frequency it can go to. That will show you how "tight" the bass will be. Now low volume levels on a good sub will produce that bass for you without vibrating your walls (though subwoofer and speaker isolation as well as PLACEMENT (refer to the sub-crawl) will do more for getting the most sound out of your speakers without having to turn up the volume....and just turn off the sub after a reasonable time)Now as to how to add a subwoofer to your system will depend on what setup you have and the available connections. If your speakers or amplifier has a subwoofer output simply connect that to your subwoofer set the crossover freuency (the frequency at which the subwoofer will start making sound) to 80hz or lower depending on how low of a frequency our bookshelves can go down to.If your speakers/amp do not have a subwoofer out you will need to find a subwoofer that has [high level speaker inputs](http://www..this_link_was_already_broken_in_the_op). You will need to connect your bookshelves to the speaker outputs on the subwoofer via speaker wire/banana plugs and then run speaker wire/banana plugs from the subwoofer input to your amplifier ending with rca to 3.5mm connection to your pc.- Dayton Audio SUB-800 $100: The cheapest one don't go any cheaper. Enough said. Get from parts-express. If you need cheaper 2nd hand market.- Dayton Sub-1000 $120: The bigger brother. This thing is 10 inches be prepared for a BIG box sitting in your room.- Bic Acoustech PL-200 $300: Has good bass goes down to 22hz. Very good bang for buck "good" subwoofer. A BIG step up from the daytons.- SVS SB-1000 $500: Bassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.# HEADPHONESGenerally headsets are for the most part frowned upon by audiophiles well because they usually offer garbage audio quality for how much you are paying. The way around this was to get a proper pair of headphones and then buy a separate USB mic or get a v-moda or antlion modmic as those are designed to be attached to your headphones to mimic the headset functionality. The TWO EXCEPTIONS that I have observed to this rule are the Hyperx Clouds and Cooler Master mh751/752 and the recent hyperx headsets that were made in collaboration with Audeze. ## - Hyperx Cloud CORE/1/2/ALPHA (please find prices on amazon). So these headphones are a rare instance of when a gaming branded pair of headphones was actually a good no bullshit product. These are hyperx reskins of OEM Takstar Pro 80 a pretty damn good pair of cans from china for under $50 (no longer available on aliexpress but Seoul had a SHIT load of these) with a mic attached to it. Chief this is it. Reasonably good audio quality from headphone drivers for their price and you get a mic for discord needs.- Coolermaster MH751/752 $90/110. Now beware on amazon there are the mh630/650/670 series headphones that are in the same...product "selection" styling part of the product page. Do NOT GET THESE these are the typical bullshit gaming branding and are pretty bad. Now the mh751 and 752s are coolermaster's copycat of the hyperx clouds. They are coolermaster reskins of the Takstar pro 82 another good pair of headphones. I cannot comment on this one as I have not used either the takstar variant nor the cm variant. But the pro 82s are just as good as the 80s. If i had to guess different styling (headband) and maybe slightly different sound signature. Difference between the 2 is the dac (the block thing in between your headphones and the wires to your pc). The dac the mh752 is most likely inferior to the dac on your mobo's build-in soundcard. Get the 751 unless you have a laptop then the 752's dac may be better.- Audio-Technica ath-m40x $80: You may have heard of the ath-m50/x. Now these headphones are looked down on on the headphone forums or reddit. The m40/x is the bass reduced aka the neutral version of the m50x for cheaper too. Great headphones for under $100. Now I have owned the m50 waay back and I think if you enjoy bass then go for it. After all they are YOUR fuckin pair of headphones and ears who are others to say shit?- Sony MDR7506 $100: I remember these were $75 but I guess everything changed when the coronavirus attacked. Anyway these are the venerated mdr7506 the industry standard for headphones in the professional audio/music industry. Great quality cheap price. They just dont have anything going on in the looks department. These are it for pure price/performance.- Phillips SHP-9600 $130: The successor to the popular shp-9500. A budget open-back headphones that could be powered without a dedicated amp with great soundstage for this price. The 9600 aims to be the sleeker improvement.- BeyerDynamic DT770 (32 90 250 ohms) $150: Good pair of cans very comfortable. 32 ohm version if simply plugging into your motherboard. The higher ohm versions may require separate headphone amp. Generally more amps=better audio quality but differences are NEGLIGIBLE to nonexistent with low output amps (this is like the difference in sound of the same 100w speaker powered by a $30 smsl amp vs a $5000 Mcintosh amp at the same volume levels very subtle and small but it's there) The biggest downside to the dt770 (and beyerdynamic in general) is that the beyer house sound is treble peaky and very bright. I personally cannot stand the beyer sound as the treble spike in their house sound is painful to my ears. - Hifiman he400 2020 edition/ he4xx $160: the new 2020 edition of the he400 is out pretty much leaving the he4xx kaput. The he400 2020 edition has the nicer headband from the Deva model while managing to match the 4xx's price. The budget king of planar headphones. - Shure 440/840/1540 $100-500: Shure is a renowned name in the audio world. Their gear is always high quality and their headphones are no exception. Their entire lineup is really solid all around with good build quality and sound quality. You can't go wrong with this brand.- Sennheiser 650/6xx from massdrop/660 $220-$400. The legendary series of headphones from sennheiser. Highly venerated. This is the pair of headphones that is usually present in any audiophile's headphone collection. The 600 line has been around for a very long time and have received endless praise. I personally have a 6xx and while they are difficult to drive and require a good amp for $220 the sound quality you get is really just amazing. Open back design and does not suffer from "fragile" issues that planars seem to have in general. Very comfortable light and neutral sounding on the side of warm. - Meze 99 noir/classics: - HifiMAN DEVA with Bluemini Receiver $300: Interesting set of open-back planar headphones that came out recently that also allow for usb connection as well as 3.5mm but the bluetooth function is a separate module (with a built-in mic) that you connect to the side of the headphones. So it's actually a wired set of planar headphones but the separate bluetooth module also allows for wireless connection. The module only has enough battery for 5ish hours so while that is charging you will have to use the wired connection. This is a usb dac/amp/bluetooth module rolled into one. Very stylish and interesting design.- Audeze Mobius $400: "Gaming" wireless headphones from Audeze a high end audiophile grade planar magnetic headphone manufacturer. If those words don't mean anything to you these are wireless headphones with a detachable mic made by an extremely respected audiophile headphone manufacturer. If you want wireless headphones I would also suggest these or the hifiman deva. These are closed-back headphones vs Hifiman's open back. These headphones also have an onboard dac for usb/3.5mm/bluetooth connection. Now obviously there's other choices. A metric fuck load of them. But I had to account for how much you should be paying (price range) for upgrades in sound quality and performance.## Example options (Wireless headsets)Okay. Wireless headsets now let's think why do you need a wireless headset? Do you want to walk around your house while on discord? Maybe you want to keep the headset on while having to afk real quick for a smoke break or whatnot.- TaoTronics 5.0 Bluetooth transmitter+receiver unit $30. It's a small device that can either A: give your non-bt PC bluetooth capabilities by acting as a receiver or give your wired headphones wireless connectivity to your pc by acting as a transmitter. This thing is battery powered (like a wireless gaming headset) up to 10 hours. You just plug your wired headphones in put the thing in your pocket and leave your pc.- See Hifiman Deva above.- Other wireless recommendations: Sennheiser pxc 550Sony wh1000xm3 and Bose QC35.# MICS- V-MODA BoomPRO $30: this is a mic with a 3.5mm that plugs in to your headphones that have a removable cable simple.- Antlion modmic $50: yes the modmic. You've probably heard of this.- Fifine K669B condensor mic $46: simple mic on a stand that plugs in via usb. Imo has better recording quality than Blue snowball.- Blue Snowball $57: Yes you've most definitely heard of this.Other mics? Yes but are they worth the extra $$ for marginally better audio recording? You decide. # Concluding remarksCool. Stay safe in these dark times brothers. Have a glorious day."
"It’s almost 3am and I just finsihed my first ever build. Pushing the power button and seeing the bios screen come up for the first time was indeed very satisfying experience. Here is the spec I ended up with - [parts](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/66Wpbh)Overall spent $1080 so far. I have a mix of used and new stuff in there:Used 3900xt for $300Used DRP4 $50Used GPU $35 (burner for a month or two waiting for RDNA2 reviews)Prime day deals on PSU and MB. Overall experience: Much easier than I thought its going to be. Plugging in all cables was the most time consuming part. The next hardest thing was keying in Windows 10 product key using virtual keyboard. Why? I totally forgot about getting a keyboard. The last time I had a PC with keyboard was 2002. Being used to laptop never realized I’d need keyboard 😂. Luckily mouse came to rescue. By the way thanks to all the helpful posts around here. I too got help last week and I have been lurking for a while. Time to get some sleep.

I got it for a discounted price though $40 part of work perks. Also forgot to mention I started build primarily for editing/workstation. Now I’m thinking of skipping Xbox refresh and invest in a good GPU instead. The one I have now is used R9 270X bought from FB market placeEdit2: Apologies for mixup with pcpartpicker link.

" Ok so I'm sorry if this is common knowledge but i just found this out yesterday and thought i would share just in case it would help someone else... So I have a 2080 and wasn't really impressed with my performance on channels like jaystwocents and LTT said that playing siege on 1440p you should be expecting around 120 fps and i was barely getting 70 with 1080p. I was a bit stumped as to why but then I went into NVIDIA control panel Manage 3D settings > DSR - factors which is what resolution your gpu is making then it down scales it to your monitors resolution and mine was set to 3 times my monitors resolution I turned it down to 1.2 times and set the settings in siege to do the same now I'm getting 200 fps just a psa I feel kinda dumb now that I found it but oh well.

(Note: the "F" at the end of each CPU means it doesn't have integrated graphics: this makes it cheaper but if you don't use a dedicated GPU get the non-F variant):    * < $100 - Intel i3 12100F; Intel i3 10100/10105(F) (if there's no cheap motherboard for the 12100)   * $100-150 - Intel i3 12100(F); Intel i5 11400F (if available for that price)   * $150-200 - Intel i5 12400F (much better than 11400F but motherboards are also more expensive)   * $200-250 - Intel i5 12400F; Intel i5 12500 (if you need integrated graphics); AMD Ryzen 5600G (if you need integrated graphics only)   * $250-300 - Intel i5 12600K(F); AMD Ryzen 5600X (pretty much superceded by the i5 12400 though)   * $300-400 - Intel i7 12700K(F); Intel i7 12700F (if you're not overclocking so you can get a cheaper motherboard); AMD Ryzen 5800X (if close to $300); Ryzen 5700G (if you need integrated graphics only)   * $400-600 - Intel i9 12900K(F); Ryzen 5900X (only if you want/neeed to use aircooling as the 12900k is not easily air-cooled but the 5900X is)   * $600-800 - AMD Ryzen 9 5950X (for workstation applications; Intel i9 12900K(F) (for gaming**CPU COOLERS:*** The best general advise it look at cooler reviews like from [Gamers Nexus](https://youtu.be/bJaJeP7bylE?t=918) on youtube or articles like this: [https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers4181.html](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers4181.html)* Many people will tell you buy a 3rd party cooler to replace the included cooler on most budget-midrange CPUs. The coolers included can however cool the CPUs they come with just fine - big caveat being that they become **loud** and **hot**.* All coolers should come with a rated maximum heat off-load which can be compared to the maximum heat output of a CPU.* All In One water coolers (AiO) are not always better than air cooling where expensive air cooling is often performing better than cheap water coolers.    * For AiO coolers make sure your case can actually fit the AiO you want. The easiest way to check is either just googling it putting your case into PCPartpicker.com where all AiOs that don't fit will be filtered out with the compatibility filter.   * [Here's an in-depth review of Air vs Water-cooling by Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VzXHUTqE7E)   * Pretty much all consumer CPUs can be cooled with Air with the exception of the i9 12900K and i7 12700K as a borderline case (at full load) needing beefy liquid cooling. Anything below that can be cooled by both it becomes an aesthetic choice and Liquid Cooling can be chosen for reduced noise at high load.    * [Here's an in-depth consolidation of what CPU cooler to buy in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vex9_84VpYs) but here also some recommendations (remember that prices can vary greatly over time and per country and should always be chosen on a per-situation basis:      * < $40 - **Vetroo V5** (needs seperate mounting bracket for intel 12th gen); Be Quiet Pure Rock  2;  **ID-COOLING SE-224-XT****;**  **Cooler Master Hyper 212** **Evo; ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports (single)**      * $40-60 - **Scythe Fuma 2;**  **ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports DUO****;**  **Noctua NH-U12S redux** **(only if build quality & support is very important to you)**      * $60-80 - **Scythe Fuma 2; Be Quiet Dark Rock 4**      * $80-110 - **Be Quiet Dark Rock Pro 4; Noctua NH-D15; Arctic Liquid Freezer 240/280 (AIO);**  **be quiet!

This lets the pc run the memory in dual channel mode. Imagine a road: no matter how well optimized your road is if you only have 1 lane it won't move as fast than when you have two lanes. This performance uplift isn't 100% but anywhere from 0% to 40% depending on the game. Here's a test performed: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hardwaretimes.com/single-channel-vs-dual-channel-ram-which-one-is-better-for-gaming/amp/Note however that even if a (consumer) motherboard has 4 ram slots occupied its still in dual channel mode. Consult your manual to see which slots you should occupy first to run dual-channel (it's often the 2nd and 4th slot from the CPU outwards)* Even in 2022 16GB memory is enough for almost all games with a few exceptions like heavily modded games and flight simulators.* As of 2022 the speed sweetspot is 3600MT/s at CL16 (or Cas Latency) or 4000MT/s CL18 before diminishing returns start kicking in. This depends on the CPU you're using though and if you're on a tight budget 3200 MT/s at CL16 or 3600 MT/s at CL18 offers great value still. Here are some performance benchmarks including DDR5: https://youtu.be/LU_w9fZvSso* As of today DDR5 is simply not worth it yet due to the huge premium (up to 3x the price of ddr4 although slowly creeping down) except for very rare cases where you either have a super high budget (let's say $5000+) or run applications that are very memory bandwidth dependant like code compiling. The performance uplift over DDR4 is frankly laughable ( https://youtu.be/fIN8lLhSqmg ).   * This will most likely change in a few years but you'll be much better off waiting those few years to combine a DDR5 purchase with a new platform release (new CPU motherboard) as DDR5 will be cheaper faster and at a point where it actually matters for consumer applications.* If you want to "future proof" your pc you're better off upgrading your GPU or CPU than spending hundreds of $ on DDR5 but as I mentioned if you're already maxed out in specs you might consider it.**MOTHERBOARDS*** Motherboards come in 3 different standardized sizes mini-ITX (ITX) micro ATX (mATX) and (standard) ATX (sATX). I'm disregarding E-ATX as it's just not popular for consumers (anymore). They correspond to their phsysical size and what PC Cases they might fit in. Some people really enjoy their PC being as small as possible thus mini-ITX being the only option with an ITX Case like the popular Cooler Master MasterBox NR200P.   * This has drawbacks though as you'll only have 2 memory slots instead of 4 few or no PCI expansion slots (think network cards) less I/O (USB etcetera) fewer M.2 slots (see the "STORAGE" section) and tend to be more expensive than mATX and ATX* Not that a standard mid-tower ATX case will fit all mentioned sizes but you'll have more and more empty space in your case.    * mATX is a good budget option and sits between ITX and ATX - It's often cheaper than ATX and can come with both 2 and 4 memory slots. In the meanwhile ATX cases can in turn be cheaper and/or better than mATX cases due to popularity making an ATX case with an mATX a good value option at times although not the most aesthetically pleasing. * For AMD CPUs the "AM4 socket" has existed for around 5 years now. [Here's a chart to show what CPU and Motherboard compatibility is like](https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HzyuYmRJC340D1di.jpg) but you can also just use the compatibility filter on PCPartpicker.com. Note that to be able to run a modern Ryzen CPU on an older motherboard the BIOS needs to be up to date and some boards need an original compatible CPU to do so. * Secondly is the "chipset" where I'll only talk about the current relevant boards for consumers.

Power supplies are one of the few parts that can't objectively be tested or reviewed by consumers as they lack the equipment needed to paint a good picture of a power supply's objective quality.   * The reviews that matter are professional reviews from sites like Tomshardware Techpowerup Jonnyguru etc.: [http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/why-99-percent-of-power-supply-reviews-are-wrong/](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/why-99-percent-of-power-supply-reviews-are-wrong/)   * I would like to refer you to this page by [u/vagabond139](https://www.reddit.com/user/vagabond139/) who goes into detail about choosing reviewing or recommending power supplies: [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/g36fdc/this\_sub\_and\_psus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/g36fdc/this_sub_and_psus/)&#x200B;* For **Power Supplies** the **"80+" rating** barely says anything about the quality of the power supply   * It only says someting about the power efficiency of the unit: how efficiently the power supply can transform the power from the wall to your components    * Although to be sure you're best off reading reviews yourself [this is a good "Tier List" to have as a reference whether a power supply is trustworthy](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/).   * This shows for example that the Seasonic S12III Bronze should be avoided (E-tier) while the same brand with similar reported specifications (and sometimes price) like the Seasonic Core GC can actually be pretty good. Brand loyalty is not something you can rely on.   * Something like the Bitfenix Formula Gold is a very cheap 80+ Gold rated power supply of a brand that almost no one has heard of but performs very well due to being designed very efficiently putting in A-tier: defeating power supplies that can be much more expensive.  * Even powerful gaming PCs use much less power than most people think and quality power supplies can easily handle short-term peaks that might supercede even the maximum rated wattage.   * Let's take a look my rendering PC at work a powerful PC with a [16-core CPU and an RTX2080 ti](https://outervision.com/b/WxiXSa). Outervision says it's rated for 547W and that's when the CPU and GPU are both at 100% load - something that won't happen 99% of the time.    * There's a caveat though: the 80+ efficiency ratings are rated as such when the the power supply uses less 80% of its recommended maximum load and depending on the power supply it will be at its **maximum efficiency between 40% and 75% load although the actual difference in % efficiency is pretty msall**. People will take this number and the PC specs (let's take my office PC as an example again) and say "well it's 547W so double that and you'd need a 1000W or 1200W power supply. But again - the PC will almost never be at full 100% load. Although not the most efficient a quality 650W power supply would be good enough here.   * **Power supplies should not be skimped on with your budget but buy a GOOD power supply instead of one with higher numbers**  * I won't be making any specific recommendations as prices can vary greatly. You're best off deciding what wattage you need; if you have a budget left go for gold rated PSU as it's a nice investment. Just go to PCP and sort by lowest price. Then just work your way down until you find one that's well reviewed and priced at that specific time.**STORAGE** * First and foremost check out u/NewMaxx and his excellent best buy guide an excellent source for all things related to SSDs.https://www.reddit.com/user/NewMaxx/comments/9yv0c6/ssd_buying_guide_wip/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share* Hard drives should never be used anymore as your main drive where Windows is installed on.    * Hard drives still has its place at it remains by far the cheapest storage in price/GB data.   * Hard drives don't affect gaming performance but will MASSIVELY increase loading times and when a hard drive is almost full stuttering can occur while the game is trying to load in more data.* For gaming specifically **M.2 NVMe drives** (that are installed directly onto the motherboard) are actually barely to [not any faster than traditional 2.5" SATA SSDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt_iJTrzOus) when it comes to loading games.   * [Here's another blind test by Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DKLA7w9eeA)   * Footnote: the new technology "[Direct Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXV3jrwkv0I)" will be deployed for Windows 11 and Windows 10 to a bit lesser extend where the GPU can access the (texture) data directly from the drive instead of having to go through the CPU first.  This could mean the end of in-game loading times all-together. * Getting a PCIe gen 4 drive for that NOW is almost always  a waste of money due to the large premium youre paying. That money is much better used for other parts and hell: you can always buy another SSD down the line when they're cheaper AND better when it actually matters* If you are buying an NVMe SSD though the "Sequential read/write" statistic is another stat that is somewhat misleading for the average. The random read/write speed or "IOPS" is what will actually matter for stuff like opening software or just the overall responsiveness of your operating system.    * It should be noted however that IOPS is always SOMEWHAT correlated to the sequential speeds    * [Here's a good video explaining it by Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omEm40cIsI0)      * TL;DW - The "Sequential speed" is only useful for moving copying or scrubbing through large files like when you're working on a big video editing project or making complicated 3d renders loading in assets  etcetera. * People tend to hate on [QLC nand drives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WACyyFF_ci0) due to faster degradation and small write cache (where when you're transferring large files the speed will DRASTICALLY drop down at some point) . QLC drives can however still offer good value/$ and as mentioned earlier the actual performance for games between drives is very small.* For a PC that is just meant for gaming there is no need to spend 50% extra on an SSD. An NVMe SSD like the Team MP33 WD Blue SN570 or Kingston A2000 will perform for gaming practically the same as something like the Samsung 970 Evo. while being just 2/3rd of the price.    * Let me repeat that this is just for Gaming. For large file transfers high resolution video editing or other professional software like CAD it can make a big difference. **CASES*** Although it is true that the best options there are for gaming PCs are those cases with a mesh front-panel to allow for good airflow there seems to be a misconceptions that all other cases are now no longer an option.   * However this comes back to the point of the Coolers: It's about how much heat your case needs to dispatch: a normal midrange PC with something like an i5 12400 and RTX3060  will be fine in a case like the  [Phanteks Eclipse P300](https://www.amazon.com/Phanteks-Eclipse-Steel-Tower-Tempered/dp/B075DMYVBV) or [Corsair 4000D](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-4000D-Tempered-Glass-Mid-Tower/dp/B08C7CJ8XZ) (standard non-airflow model). In a noise-normalized the test the Corsair 4000D Airflow is about 3-7 degrees Celsius cooler than the standard Corsair 4000D. If you have super high hardware you want to keep off the high temperatures to avoid thermal throttling but we're talking about going from 54C to 61C with midrange hardware with the same noise levels. This has 0.0% effect on gaming or any other performance metrics (again unless you're running up to 90C+ with high end hardware where airflow becomes very important).   * That being said you do of course want to get the most out of your CPU cooler for example and not be choked by a closed front panel so the move to a mesh design is a good direction to go in in my any many others' opinion.  I'm just saying that 'closed' cases are still perfectly fine as long as they're designed with decently alternative cooling solutions like [negative pressure setup cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQE0BWmGzto).Here are some recommendations:| Brand          | Model              | Price   | Form Factor      | Mesh Front? | RGB fans? | Glass sidepanel? | Notes:                                                                                          ||----------------|--------------------|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| Corsair        | 4000D              | if ~$60 | ATX mid tower    | No          | No        | Yes              | Great value and quality but mediocre airflow                                                   || Corsair        | 4000D Airflow      | ~$95    | ATX mid tower    | Yes         | No        | Yes              | Very popular good looking and Great overall quality/performance                                || BitFenix       | Nova Mesh SE       | $50     | ATX mid tower    | Yes         | Yes       | Either           | Budget RGB mesh tower                                                                           || Antec          | NX410              | $75     | ATX mid tower    | Yes         | Yes       | Yes              |                                                                                                 || Deepcool       | MATREXX 55 MESH    | $59     | ATX mid tower    | Yes         | Yes       | Yes              |                                                                                                 || Thermaltake    | Versa H18          | $40     | mATX Mini Tower  | Yes         | Either    | Yes              | Nice budget mATX tower                                                                          || Phanteks       | Eclipse P300A Mesh | $55     | ATX Mid Tower    | Yes         | No        | No               | Minimalistic good quality case if priced right                                                  || Thermaltake    | Core V1            | $60     | mini-ITX desktop | Yes         | No        | No               | Nice budget ITX desktop                                                                         || Cooler Master  | NR200P             | $95     | mini-ITX desktop | No          | No        | Yes              | Good quality roomy clean ITX desktop                                                           || Be Quiet       | Pure Base 500DX    | $100    | ATX mid tower    | Yes         | No        | Yes              | RGB on front of case and integrated LED strip inside.

It's frankly a whole other discussion during the current shortage and we can only hope things  get better sooner than later. * If you're in the USA you could consider entering the Newegg Shuffle for a graphics card here you can get a bit better deal on graphics so you might not have to sell your kidney: https://www.newegg.com/product-shuffle* Buying a 2nd hand GPU may offer better value for your system. A GTX1070 or RX580 8GB is priced around the same as the RX6500XT ($280-ish) while offering much better performance. You can always ask here which 2nd hand GPU might be best for your budget.* For a PC meant for gaming try avoiding Nvidia's "GT" cards (not "GTX") like the GT710 GT730 or GT1030. The integrated graphics of the Ryzen 5600G are literally faster than these cards and are a complete waste of money   * They are especially scummy because of being rebranded multiple times with the same name while performance is wildly different; sometimes not even being able to launch games at all.   * Consider them glorified display adapters that's it.* As of January 2022 the midrange options from AMD have a better value than Nvidia's counterparts. This mainly concerns the AMD Radeon RX6600 and RX6600XT models. They're comprible to the Nvidia 3060 and 3060ti and while lacking some nice features like DLSS and Raytracing the Nvidia counterparts are often price more than 50% higher than the 6600 lineup making them hard to recommend. If you can get a good deal on a 3060 it changes the story of course.* [For people with lower budget be careful with the AMD Radeon RX 6500XT especially if you're installing it in a system without PCIE 4.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5_oM3Ow_CI) (From Ryzen 3000 and Intel 11th gen and after) **MONITORS*** Modern Monitors come in 3 standard resolutions and they all in part have an ultrawide (or super-ultra wide) variant keeping the same pixels per inch: 1080p Full HD 1440p Quad HD and 2160p 4K each subsequent tier will pretty drastically improve visual fidelity but especially for games be more demanding for your graphics card. Don't know what to choose? here's a good video: https://youtu.be/YAOQaMMGbcw   * As a general rule of thumb (for standard 16:9 displays): 1080p up to 24" 1440p up to 30" and 4k from 30 inches and up will give a good balance between pixels per inch to deliver a good viewing experience.There are 4 mainstream different types of display panel: IPS VA and TN and OLED with some minor variants. Hardware Unboxed recently put out an excellent video which to choose in 2022: https://youtu.be/luLS-I9lubg   * TL;DW - Gaming in darker environments? Take a good VA monitor due to high contrast ratio. Overall best experience? Take IPS. Doing any creative work? IPS. Pro e-sports? High end TN with backlight strobing. * The difference in 60hz to 144hz is HUGE but has significant diminishing returns after that point. IF YOU BOUGHT A HIGH REFRESH RATE MONITOR CHANGE THE REFRESH RATE MANUALLY IN THE WINDOWS MONITOR SETTINGS OR IT WILL STAY AT 60HZ! * Monitors suffer from the same problem as power supplies where the only stats shown are the resolution panel type response times and refresh rate. This is nice and all but it again doesn't say anything about the actual quality and HOW they achieve those specs (or not with false advertising). Especially the "1ms" response times are often incorrect and vary greatly from monitor to monitor. * Stats like brightness contrast smearing/ghosting levels colour performance are all stats that the manufacturers keep for themselves but actually make up a very important aspect on whether a monitor is good.   * A good example is high refresh rate monitors that experience bad blurring ghosting and overshoot due to being overclocked more than the display can actually handle which is almost false advertising. It's like cranking up the engine of a Toyota Corolla to 400HP to call it a sports car only to spin on its wheels and slip off the road because it's not designed for that power. * HDR (High Dynamic Range) display certification is another one that's tricky and regulations should be tightened for these certificates. An "HDR600" display has a peak brightness of 600 nits (candela/m²) but many budget HDR monitors cannot sustain this brightness for any meaningful amount of time or simultaneous bright area size while certification are still given out. This has to be looked at per situation and monitor.* Hardware Unboxed generally provides the best monitor reviews out there and are very consumer friendly. They recently put out a tier list with price/performance and it's a really good watch if you're in the market for a monitor: https://youtu.be/hk5DtR8alKo* You should also look into ergonomic options like a height adjustable stand or swivel.* You can get really good budget monitors nowadays with excellent colours response times minimal ghosting and freesync like the AOC 24g2 for around $180 and already comes with an IPS display at 144hz at 1080p . But high refresh rate 1440p monitors are getting better more common and cheaper like the Gigabyte M27Q setting new benchmarks for value and Samsung setting new standards for VA displays with their 240hz Odyssey G7 display.* It again comes down to watching professional reviews. A cheap $150 144hz TN 215" monitor will probably get 4.5 stars in Amazon with thousands of reviews but the objective increase in quality for just $30 more or so can be astounding. So don't be afraid to ask for advice on various subreddits!* This has already been said in the Hardware Unboxed monitor resolution video above but when you're questioning which resolution you want. Look up which graphics card you can afford (or already) have along with a benchmark video showing what framerate you can about expect.

The purpose of this post is to inform users that use Mobile Broadband USB dongles or any other Usb Modem that the windows 10 Creators update breaks **Some** older style modems.When I fresh installed windows 10 I didn't realize that I downloaded the creators update ISO. This lead to a week and a half of me writing on windows message boards and searching the internet for anyone that had this same problem. When trying to dial out with the Usb modem in my case the Mc760 from Virgin Mobile it came back with error 633 in windows and  the message "The remote computer did not respond please try again.I followed the standard troubleshooting steps of updating all drivers uninstall and reinstall try on a different computer. None of these steps worked.From my research there are a couple cases of people having this problem all buried deep in discussion boards and Microsoft help forums. As far as I can tell Microsoft hasn't officially said this problem exist and the response that I got from there support staff was contact the manufacturer for updated drivers.There is a shining light tho. After a week of trying to fix this problem I found out you can still download Windows 10 Anniversary update ISO's from Microsoft if you access there site from a non windows device saying you are going to install it on a mac since Macs are having problems with the Creators update instillation. Microsoft has kept this Older ISO download active just buried Deep with in there site.**The Big Point**Be Careful when updating to creators update from Microsoft if you use a USB Dongle for internet. I was lucky and found a way to download another ISO but that strategy might not always work.**Edit:** The Problem appears to be fixed while a Temporary fix has been out for about a month [Here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/dial-up-error-633-winstall-of-build-15063/2c5b280e-e246-4105-b8e6-58e413d2668e?tm=1491426971838) Microsoft has released [KB4022716](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4022716/windows-10-update-kb4022716) which claims to "Addressed issue where after upgrading to Windows 10 RS2 modem dial-up fails with Error 633.  " I am glad that this problem was actually fixed and not thrown to the side."

No idea where it came from or who brought it in UPDATE: It was also ripped out of the little brother's old PC and it was the restart button. Since it was still a 1pin connector we just plugged it into the powerSW slot and it seems to work just fine!* zip ties o' plenty* cable management level: a s c e n d e d * yes his headphones are hanging off of a binder clipTotal amount that he paid for all this: ~$300cad (for neither party wanted to just give/ take the GPU for free and he wanted to buy a CPU cooler).His total happiness level afterward: Maximum :)EDIT1: Holy shit we did not expect this post to blow up to this degree! Here are some general responses to some of the most common questions/ responses:1. "How is this ghetto? These specs are better than mine!" - It's a PC that's made entirely out of hand-me-downs and it's **built into a crate with zero cable management**. The fact that the parts are pretty good in of themselves is out of sheer luck and some kindness too. As for the "found a 7700 in a drawer" yeah we think it's as funny and ridiculous as you guys do! We didn't mean to shame any of your guys' builds either since even if your specs aren't technically as good it probably looks a thousand times better on your desk/ floor and won't run into ridiculous issues that a fully open DIY project like this will. If I didn't happen to have the 1070 it would have been a 780 in there most likely!2. "Why didn't you guys just field a proper case? You probably could have found something for free just as easily as the crate!" - There actually is one sitting right next to the build... The madlad insisted we use the crate instead.3. "What are the other things in frame? The monitor? The tablet?" - The monitor is an acer sa240y though he can't remember where he got it. The tablet is a cintiq which he got second hand on ebay for $250cad a couple years ago. The keyboard is a hand me down from his brother and it's a G710+. For the keen eyed people who noticed the mic it's a unbranded clip on mic which is normally used for interviews. He apparently got it in china but he's not entirely sure. The mouse is a g502 and the mousepad is a random gel one he yoinked from his mom ages ago: It has tape on it because it started leaking!... And yes he has a pair of xm4's... He did buy them for %30 off (~$350cad) but that is indeed more than he's paid for this build so far. Question it all you want he doesn't care!EDIT3: Some general difficulties that we had while building this:1. There were no mountingpoints for the motherboard (or anything else for that matter) so we drilled some holes and used zip ties wherever possible. Thankfully they were able to fit through the standoff holes on the motherboard itself!2. The issue of not knowing if it's ok to just let these parts sit on top of the plastic (particularly the mobo). Some of you guys brought this up and we're already working on getting a little pad to put underneath it to act as a buffer. Made of a non-static inducing material of course! UPDATE: The madlad mentioned at the top managed to get the back panel of an old PC case underneath the mobo so the mobo is now sitting on top of normal mounting points with that being zip tied to the crate. If we run into/ think of any issues then we have some anti-static wrap that we can use as further protection which we'll most likely apply when the CPU cooler comes in.EDIT4: That's pretty much all the information I've been able to gather from everyone who was a part of the process so I'll stop editing the post now. Thanks for all the attention once again!"
"If I buy a used PSU and it fails within it's 10 year warranty can I send it in or would I need original proof of purchase?EDIT: After reading through most of the major factories info they say warranty is not transferable.

"I bought an RM850x for an MSI 3080 X Trio. The GPU has 3x 8 pin ports. My psu came with 3 PCIe 8 pin (6+2) cables and they all split on one end. Do I need to use 3 of these cables from the PSU connecting to the PSU ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/FEDA5hy.png))? Or do I use 1 cable for 2 of the 8pin ports and then another for just 1? [\(like this\)](https://i.imgur.com/QbETwbz.png)Or do I need to buy new power cables that don't have splitters? It seems weird that the PSU did not come with any.**EDIT**: Thanks for the replies everyone. The recommended answer to my question is to use 3 PCIe cables coming from the PSU rather than 2 cables. [This guy does a good job of explaining why](https://youtu.be/gJdvW3LnElw?t=250)."
"This is something we're seeing coming up again recently with the Nvidia and Intel product launches.    You cannot forget that it is the responsibility of a company to earn your money by producing a product worthy of the purchase. Preordering is something we're having huge problems with in the video game industry and it's starting to spread its sickly tentacles into hardware.    The entire concept of preordering is anti-consumer. By doing so you're surrendering your agency to a corporation that has no loyalty to anything except for profit. When companies can get your money before they've demonstrated that their product is worth purchasing they have no motivation to make the best product they can.    Never Preorder.    EDIT: Alright RIP the inbox this blew up yada yada. To all the people commenting that "you're allowed to spend your money however you like" I agree with you. You are allowed to. But you [shouldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf5Uj4XIT1Y). And there's a [ton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7zxKMSSM4U&t=15s) of [information](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-pre-ordering-video-games/) out there produced by [smarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3og4bo/eli5_why_preordering_is_bad/) people than myself who can [explain](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/reasons-not-preorder-video-games.html/) why better than I [can.](https://www.polygon.com/2016/6/12/11913998/e3-pre-orders-exclusive-beta-dont-do-it) [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/9msryq/just_a_reminder_never_preorder/) was originally made in reference to [Intel's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1mJMI_uaa8) intentionally [misleading](https://www.techspot.com/article/1722-misleading-core-i9-9900k-benchmarks/) benchmarks that they released during their embargo on [independent reviewers](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/278526-the-core-i9-gaming-benchmarks-intel-commissioned-against-amd-are-a-flat-lie) so that their results couldn't be [refuted](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3311827/computers/never-preorder-why-jumping-on-new-technology-before-its-tested-is-a-bad-idea.html). And I don't need to remind anyone of the RTX fiasco.    Most people have assumed I was referring to games specifically. And that's fine because game preorders are a huge problem too. I have strong opinions on the subject because I believe that [games matter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) and that the medium deserves to be a respected art form. But hype is no substitute for quality. Knowing that you're going to buy a game no matter what is fine that's a personal decision. Preordering the game and helping provide the developer with a data point that says "X% of the projected audience of this product will purchase it based on our promises alone" is madness. Maybe it's good for you as an individual because you get your shitty skin or whatever. But it's not good for the industry. And don't even get me started on actual gameplay-enhancing pre-order bonuses or even worse "early access". It's manipulative marketing at it's best and we as a consumer base shouldn't stand for it.    But by all means keep calling me names and explaining why I'm a fascist idiot. "
"Hi everyoneMy son has been asking for a gaming PC his very first one months ago.I told him that he'll have to earn it by working hard at school nothing's free right ?Well he did and got excellent results way beyond my expectations !Xmas 2019 is coming so he asked for it again. Problem: I couldn't save enough money for him and told him to give me some time and maybe he will get it for his birthday on April 2020 :(Here in France PC parts cost a kidney.He wasn't upset at all he's a good kid and he knows that we get rewarded for our daily actions.We parents always do our best for our kids. I didn't want him to think that he worked hard in vain.So I sold my entire superheroes DC Comics collection figures ( sayonara Superman ) and got the money for him he doesn't know this that's our secret !I was aiming for a mid end and future proof gaming PC so that he won't be frustrated for the few upcoming years. Kids grow up fast he's already 14 and time flies fast. Maybe he'll leave the house in 3 or 4 years to go to college.I remembered being broke as a student and I just wanted him to have a decent and yet upgradable PC replacing one or two parts such as a GPU or CPU is easier than changing the whole PC  isn't it ?So I got all the parts and built in secret a mini itx PC again so that is easier to carry and store in a student dorm room.Some people only think as far as tomorrow I think years ahead.Building in that NZXT H210 case was very easy thanks to its size. I went on a pink and blue theme since those are his favorite colors.- I decided to go red with a Ryzen 3700x since he's very interested in video editing and rendering and some other stuffs that might require a powerful CPU.- The Enermax Aquafusion 120 AIO cools down that beast and does a better job than the Prims cooler ( which was already decent ) that comes with the CPU.- Then a RX 5700 XT should be more than enough to play on a wide QHD monitor ( couldn't buy it yet have to save money he'll play on a TV temporary ). The Sapphire Nitro Plus version seems to be a good choice good temps silent and wow beautiful ! It fits really tight but it FITS :)- The Trident Z neo 3600 mhz RAM are here to let the Ryzen 3700x fully express itself.- For the OS i went on a SSD m.2 Corsair MP 510 500 gb should be enough to handle Windows 10 and all his softwares.- Two SanDisk SSD Ultra 3 D 1tb and he has plenty of room for his games and other things that I don't want to know.- A SF 750 Watts power supply from Corsair to deliver some juice and help the GPU to breathe.- Added a few Enermax white case fans with beautiful RGB to highlight the components without going overkill.- With great power comes the Gigabyte Aorus x570i pro wifi that has great responsibility to support all these.- And to complete a 5 inch screen to monitor the PC yes he has to learn to keep an eye on the temps CPU and GPU load fan speed etc.And here is Sans ( referring to one of his favorite game character from Undertale ) the Mini ITX PC in all its Glory.https://fr.pcpartpicker.com/b/BMLJ7PChristmas is coming in a few days can't wait to offer him his dream PC. He has no idea what is waiting for him around the corner.I hadn't half the chance that he has now when I was a kid keep working hard keep being nice caring about the others sharing and helping and you'll be rewarded if I can see this hopefully somebody else one day will do too and again you'll get REWARDED and I promise: you won't have to hunt for happiness.Love you son.DaddySending positive vibes to all the fathers and mothers out there and wishing the best to everyone for the end of the year and the new upcoming year.Edit:Finally it's done 100 % was missing the 5 inch screen  I've run many benchmarks to test it out and so far no issue.Temps are amazingly good thanks to my cable management CPU idle 29°c and full load 61°CAs for the GPU full load never exceed 69 °Chttps://cdn.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/userbuild/275967.434eb361ade4ccdd950398d8bc7f55c0.1600.jpghttps://cdn.pcpartpicker.com/static/forever/images/userbuild/275967.e954af9fcfd5af1f3536dc586f8745ab.1600.jpgAlso wanted to thank you all tried my best to answer to everyone but I may have missed a few  so please pardon me."

"This is anecdotal and obviously my opinion..As the title states I am Nvidia's target customer. I have more money than sense and I have upgraded every gen since the 500 series. I used to SLI 560's 780's 780ti's (I know I know) 980ti's before settling on a single 1080ti 2080ti and currently have a 3090. Have a few other random cards I've acquired over the years 770 980 1080ti 2080S. All paperweights. I generally pass on my previous gen to a friend or family member to keep it in my circle and out of miner's hands. As (somewhat) selfless as that may sound once I upgrade to the new and shiny I have little regard for my old cards. Having the hardware lust I have developed over the years has me needing to have the best so I can overclock benchmark and buy new games that I marvel at for 20 minutes max before moving on to the next "AAA" title I see. I collect more than enjoy I suppose. In my defense I did finish Elden Ring this year.Now with all that said. I will not be purchasing the 4000 series. Any other year the hardware lust would have me order that 4090 in a second but I have made the conscious decision not to buy. Current pricing seems to be poised to clear out the stockpiles of current 3000 series cards. The poorly named 4070 is a bit of a joke. The pricing for the rest seems a bit too much. I understand materials cost more and that they are a business but with the state of the world this is not a good look IMO. And from a personal standpoint there are no games currently available that I am playing (20 mins stents or otherwise) or games on the horizon that come close to warranting an upgrade.Maybe the inevitable 4090ti will change my mind but if the situation around that launch is similar to now I may wait for the 5000 series. After all that I guess my question is if I'm not buying who exactly are these cards for?Edit: grammarEdit 2: After a busy day at the factory imagine my surprise coming back to this tremendous response! Lots of intelligent conversation from a clearly passionate community. Admittedly I was in something of a stupor when I typed the above but after a few edits I stand by my post. I love building PC's as much as anyone and I feel like that's where a lot of the frustration comes from a love of the hobby. I don't plan to stop building PC's - I may however take a brief respite from the bleeding edge and enjoy what I have. Anyway had to add a 1080ti to my list of paperweights above - I am a menace. Much love everyone.Edit 3: Full transparency folks - I caved. GFE invite received and I did take a night think about it. I didn’t need to upgrade but decided I wanted to. Sold the 3090 to a friend who was in the market for a fair price as a way to justify upgrading. Thoughts like “I’m helping out a friend” and “it’s not that much” filled my head before deciding to buy. Picked it up and installed yesterday. Having a PC-011D I knew it was going to be a mess while awaiting Corsair or Cablemods updated solutions. Will have to deal with a messy case and no side-panel for a bit (woe is me.)So that’s it. Probably sounds a little “do as I say not as I do” but much like IRL I give decent advice but rarely follow it. Was it a necessary upgrade? Definitely not. Am I happy with it? I guess so. Gaming season approaches I will follow up in a few weeks/months with anything worth sharing. I guess I am still Nvidia’s target customer. Cheers all."

"Overall we're seeing some uncommonly large variance in gaming benchmarks as far as the new chips are concerned from various reviewers who are **equally** well known and widely considered to be **equally** reputable.    For example Hardware Unboxed has both the [5950X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30) and [5900X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX130FUy4jk) as being virtually identical overall to both each other *and* also the i9-10900K in terms of gaming performance with the i9-10900K still specifically pulling ahead in a fair number of the games you might "expect" it to.    Unlike reviewers such as Gamer's Nexus and Linus Tech Tips Hardware Unboxed does *not* impose official-spec power limits on any of the chips they test be they AMD or Intel. I personally feel that this is *probably* the most realistic operating scenario as people who buy the i9-10900K (or 5950X or 5900X in all likelihood) for a premium gaming build definitely don't care in the slightest about power consumption and will absolutely run it in whatever configuration makes it perform most optimally and provide the most frames.    Am I saying that anyone is necessarily "absolutely unquestionably right" or "absolutely unquestionably wrong" in their testing methodology? No. Am I saying that anyone has provided results that are straight up "invalid"? Absolutely not.    What I am saying though is that you most likely should not actively expect to see identical performance as any single review showed a given chip you're going to buy as providing.    Watch and read as many reviews as you can and expect performance that is roughly an average of all of their results for your chosen CPU to avoid disappointment.    Furthermore consider how your planned overall system configuration stacks up against those reviews. What RAM are you going to buy and how does it compare to the different RAM kits they used?

Im not great with computer parts and just made a reddit to post this. The response is overwhelming. I have some more details to my original postMotherboard was a 690 not a 590. This is a coworker who seems to do this as a side gig and has a garage full of parts. He encouraged me to post this.He has seen the post LOL. He wanted to give me a future proof build and said this is about $700+ less than what he should actually sell it for.We have decided to go to a 3070 ti and a i9 10900k. We agreed to $2100 which from my basic research is still a very good value. He also is making it 32gb ram."
"A big thank you to the mods of /r/buildapc and XFX for supplying the GPU! It came in the mail and it's a THICC II! I am super excited for this upgrade from my 1660. [Here is a picture of the card.](https://imgur.com/a/2rVgPgc)[Here is a picture of it installed.](https://imgur.com/a/NtBoetz)I am currently running a 3600x B450 Tomahawk DDR4-3200 Corsair Vengeance RAM SSD HDD and Corsair TXM Gold 550w+ PSU. Time to go play some games!"
"So for the last 8.5 years I had a prebuilt which had the following specs:i7 3770 3.4Ghz 4c8tGT 630 2gb 192 cores 875mhz (codename GK107)4x4gb DDR3 1600mhz2TB HDD150gb SSDA bit of background knowledge:A lot of games like Sniper Elite 4 Fallout 4 Wolfenstein the new order The Outer Worlds Farcry series crysis 3I usually get 23 fps to 27fps (or 12 to 17 depending on the map etc) and older games I get better fps like fallout 3 fallout new vegas crysis 2 etc. I usually tweak settings from nvidia control panel to ini settings to get at least 30 fps.During the delivery I was super nervous and all but when it finally reached my country I was very happy! It felt like Im super close to getting my hands on it!When I received it I went back home unpacked it and behold wrapped so neatly! I was worried because there was a rockstar cyberpunk soda can wrapped inside the parcel too. And I didnt know how USPS would handle it too. But they did an awesome job!!I had to a buy a new PSU too so I bought a Seasonic Focus GX-750 thermal grizzly kryonaut 1ml and compressed air dusterPutting it together: I decided to swap parts and clean the fans as well as changing the thermal paste.The cooler fans were the intel push pin fans types so I understand why everyone hates it now. When swapping PSU my case is old so I dont have any area to organize wiring. Sad times. Switched out the gpu.But theres a problem computer couldn’t boot up. DRAM_LED was on and none of my IO ports were receiving signals. (My mouse and keyboard (used mobo io usb port) has led ethernet connected but no light) Single abnormal long beep when shutting down. Everyone had no clue online. Websites were giving me combo beeps.Well I took pretty much the whole day cuz I dont like rushing but I took my own time but legs are cramp af since I sat on the floor for like 8 hrs so by the time it came to debugging it was night time. The next day I had a dream thinking it would turn on but no :( my thumbs were bruising cuz I was trying to re-fit the ram into the slots and because they had no heatsink its just a thin pcb which makes pushing it a pain. They were not fitted correctly. But that still didnt allow my computer to boot up.Asked a particular online friend he told me from the abnormal shutdown beep was a ram issue. He told me something about cmos and ram being related to why it wont boot. Also I didnt know I have 12 missing components or so on my mobo (solder points there and drawing header note or something is there to say what that component is) but the component like memOK! button BIOS_FLBK pwr_fan CHA_FAN2 GPU_Boost etc missing.He told me to remove all 4 slots then place 1 ram in the 1st slot (told me how the slots were arranged) then it booted for the first 2 slots the 3rd ram did not boot when inserted to slot 3 and 4 then switched to the other ram stick and it didnt boot for slot 3 but booted up for slot 4. And everyone thought I broke my mobo or something else irrelevant.Shut it down then placed the beast gtx 1060 and installed the new drivers and restarted (I used DDU in safe mode before replacing the gpu and swapping partsI am so happy that its working now! I can play most games in ultra at 100fps and even cyberpunk 2077!To you who sent me bro I seriously appreciate it &amp;lt;3I underestimated this beast of a cardTLDR: Friend gift me a gtx 1060 6gb along with a rockstar cyberpunk soda can. Swapped out the psu for a seasonic focus gx 750 but had to sacrifice a 4gb ram stick and slot for a gpu since they became defective after testing since computer couldnt boot up. Its now working very well :DEdit: some appreciation text. I will add some pictures and benchmarks to see the changes of old and new gpu.Edit: HOLY MOLY! Thanks everyone for the kind words and awards! You all are awesome people!! Love yall and thanks for awesome support!I will be adding the benchmarks in a few hours since I just woke up (I made this post last night)Edit: Hi all apologies for the long wait I’m trying to include all (previous settings low preset 1080p and ultra/playable or low 1080p) benchmarks for everyone to see! Thank you all for being patient :)"
"1. update your monitor's drivers.2. in windows 10 search bar type "calibrate display color"3. hit "next"I was testing out my new monitor using "Blade Runner 2049" and everything was pitch black or close to it. I adjusted brightness and contrast on the back of my Omen 27i for a very long time. Nothing seemed to help. Just very black or very "bright versions of black" which basically looked like black with a glare. After I adjusted the gamma BOOM perfect. I'm a noob just thought I'd throw this out there for other noobs."
"When we talk about refresh rates we talk about a frequency in which the monitor refreshes the image on screen every second. We refer to that as hertz (hz).So for marketing this is a very easy number to advertise. Same as the Ghz wars back in the day with the CPUs. The benefit we receive we have to measure in frametimes which is the actual time between frames in which the monitor gives a fresh image.For 60hz we receive a new frame every 16.66 milliseconds. The jump to 144hz in which we receive a new frame every 6.94 ms means we shave off a total of 9.72 ms of waiting for the monitor to show a new image when we do this upgrade.240hz means we receive a new frame every 4.16 ms. So from 144hz (6.94 ms) we shave a total of 2.78 ms. To put it in context this is lower than the amount of frametimes we reduce when we upgrade from60hz to 75hz - 3.33 ms75hz to 100hz - 3.33 ms100hz to 144hz - 3.06 msThis doesn't mean it isn't noticeable. It is specially for very fast paced and competitive games but for the average person 144hz is more than enough to have a smooth performance.But what about 360hz monitors? These deliver a new frame every 2.78 ms. So the jump from 240hz to 360hz cuts 1.39 ms in frametimes. I would argue this is where it starts to get tricker to notice the difference. This jump from 240hz to 360hz is the exact same in frametimes as going from 120hz to 144hz.So to have it clean and tidy60hz to 144hz = 9.72 ms difference in frametimes144hz to 240hz = 2.78 ms difference240hz to 360hz = 1.39 ms differenceI hope this helps to clear some things out."

"**Edit: Thanks so much for all your feedback! I'm going to make some minor adjustments to the build:**  **- adding a second PCIe cable for the GPU**  **- adding a GPU support bracket**  **- adding at least one other fan on the front/input side**  Imgur gallery: [https://imgur.com/gallery/t3tNYzR](https://imgur.com/gallery/t3tNYzR)[Link to PCPartPicker list.](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/archdukegordy/saved/YGTyK8) (Edit: didn't end up getting an optical drive and several people have told me that the cooler is different. I ordered the be quiet! Dark Rock 4 BK021 200W TDP)If someone had told me even three years ago that I would build a PC one day I would have told them they're bullshitting me. I'm one of the least computer-savvy people I know. But I knew the day would come where I would have to upgrade from my (now 8-9 years old) geriatric prebuilt laptop. I wanted to play games. I wanted to start anew on a clean slate. And I wanted to do it right. So I saved up some money and spent months researching starting from getting to know the general functions of the components to comparing brands and asking for feedback.This sub has been tremendously helpful to me. I think I learned the most from first-time builders who took the time to explain the mistakes they made and what to be aware of. Little things like remembering to remove the plastic from components to ALWAYS refer to the manuals or just to be patient during assembly. I waited almost a month before I started putting together my PC mainly because I didn't have my new desk yet but also because I was scared. Even when I first unboxed the case I started freaking out thinking I couldn't do it (I asked my dad for moral support/help god bless him). But in the end it somehow turned on without any problems. (Edit: deleted a video link here)I still don't think I'm the best person to ask for advice but I will say this: Believe in yourself. If my dumb ass can do it then you can too. Just take your time and stay calm. (Also watching PC assembly videos and taking rigorous step-by-step notes ended up being super helpful.)(Also I opted out of all the peripheral lighting/RGB stuff because I kinda... think it's overkill ahahahaha)"

"I can’t stop buying things for it now. Holy shit. Like I went with a budget power supply because I didn’t need anything fancy but the yellow and black cables don’t match my case so now I need to get black and white extension cables. But if I do that then I need to get some LED fans so you can see the cable colors. Oh crap if I get LED fans you’ll be able to see the blue SATA cable hooked up to my SSD time to get some black cables. Crap my SSDs have their logo facing out and they don’t match time to get an SSD case for them. Well now I have LED fans but my CPU fan isn’t LED well I can’t have that gotta get rid of that now too. Good lord. I shouldn’t have ever gone down this rabbit hole of love.Edit: wow some of y’all are assholes and can’t stand a little sarcastic humor. I’m not OCD and freaking out about my computer. I play at 1080p 60hz and I get perfect frame rates and resolutions on all the games I want to play. I just didn’t know how much I would not only enjoy building a computer but how much I wanted to work on it aesthetically as well as performance."
"**tl;dr:** I built a hexagonal case out of Lego has 3500 pieces 32L decent thermals. Super proud of it wanted to share it :)I've always been fascinated by hexagonal designs on stuff and decided to rebuild my current Lego computer case into a full hexagonal shape. Took me about 3500 pieces and 200 hours and I finally finished it!And of course it was made out of **100% Lego** \- no adhesives glue or any non-Lego parts.**Pics:**[Lego Computer](https://imgur.com/a/CFbz0xz)The hardware is same as my old build so I won't post it here (see my [older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5cjap6/built_my_own_lego_computer/)).Case is 32L which I think is very compact for a ATX case.&#x200B;**Thermals** are 65-72 Celsius while under max stress (Prime95) and GPU at 72-81 Celsius (3DMark). While gaming the GPU never exceeds 60C. I have three 120mm fans at the bottom pulling air into the case and a 200mm fan at the top pulling the exhaust out.&#x200B;**Cost** of all parts are around $400 I don't have a proper estimate as I built it from dismantling my previous case and that already didn't have a proper estimate since I bought a lot of pieces in bulk and had a lot left over.&#x200B;I've been planning this build for a while mostly as an improvement over my old build. There's three main gripes about my old build that I wanted to improve upon:* Having a vertically aligned (I/Os facing down) case means I have to lift up my PC every time I needed to plug things in.* Having everything built in one piece and encasing the motherboard means I have to dismantle parts of the computer to access the hardware if I want to replace anything.* It's huge. It was about 44L. I've been very into sffpcs for a while and while I have an ATX board I wanted to see how small I can make it while keeping decent thermals and sticking to a hexagonal build (because rectangular is boring).Now there's a door that swings open for me to swap parts and certain panels on the case can also be removed to access the SATA/other ports.&#x200B;[Here's my build process](https://imgur.com/a/QngUZQX)Edit: Made the thermals portion more visible since most of the comments were asking about it and adding how much it costs (a lot) :("

"I live in Australia and it gets seriously hot here in summer (Dec-Feb). I'm talking over 45 Celsius/110 Fahrenheit a few times a year and regularly over 35 Celsius/95 Fahrenheit. In my Be Quiet! Silent Base 800 with 2x 140mm intake and 1x 120mm exhaust fans my heavily OC i5 6600k would get up to mid-70s under load with a Noctua NH-U12S cooler. This was at only 20 Celsius ambient temp. I was worried that in summer the machine would seriously cook so I researched a new airflow focused case. Today I shifted everything into a new Lian Li Lancool II Mesh 'Performance' case (the non-RGB version). I ran a bunch of tests including 3dMark Realbench and CoD Modern Warfare and the highest CPU temp was 62 degrees even though ambient temp was 24 Celsius today.The new case has dropped a good 15 degrees and that's with the case fans spinning much slower (and therefore quieter) than the previous case fans.GPU temps are about the same but I think that's partly because the intake fans don't spin up enough to exhaust the GPU better because the CPU never gets hot enough to trigger my fan curve uplift. Anyway just goes to show how good these newer style 'airflow' cases are. It was also super easy to build in and has much better cable management than my old case."
"Yesterday I found an issue that has been haunting me for 7 years. Back in 2014 I built a new workstation for gaming/photo editing. It was a i7-4790K/ASUS Sabertooth Z97 Mark S in all white with custom cables. So... I've been sleeving my own PC cables since the 90's and never run into an issue. However in this build (I'm guessing) my custom cables for the AX760i had a bad connection somewhere and damages the PSU. I came to this conclusion because I used the PSU for about a year with no issues. Swapped it into this new build with the custom cables and at first had no issues.After a month or so I'd start getting random reboots and blue screens under load. I thought it was overclocking settings... figured it was the motherboard... went through several motherboards CPUs RAM... went through several new builds all the way through Intel 9th Gen with this same PSU and custom cables.... every once in a while I would see small stability issues here and there.Yesterday I built a "new" i5-9600K/Z370 and it would get through the Windows installation without issue but was randomly blue screening just opening a browser or blue screening right when it got to the login screen. Sitting there after the 100th blue screen I turned slowly and looked right at the custom cables and said to myself... son of bitch. This is the probably the first time in 7 years I replaced every piece of hardware at once with exception of the PSU. Swapped the PSU for an old AX650 I had in the closet and not only have I not had a crash... but this is the smoothest my PC has ever felt.Who doesn't check the PSU through 7 years of random stability issues? Me. That's who."
"I’ve never built a PC but have really wanted to.I’ve done plenty of research into building a PC and have asked a friend who has rebuilt theirs multiple times to help build it when I get the parts.But my parents don’t trust that it’s safe since they have no knowledge about it. How can I convince them?Edit: I showed them some LTT videos and helped them to understand that it’s not difficult to mess up.

"I'm the kind of guy who builds a new rig every 4-5 years never partially upgrading.

For now the gpu is running at 8x.After I finish setting up everything I'll try some manual ram OCing for the first time :D And a lil bit of CPU OCing.I'm still waiting for the LG 48cx OLED to be in stock so I can finally move on from the TN panel.

Mostly likely he will forget but oh well :)edit: Holy shit... Thanks for the upvotes awards and your interest in my build! So many comments I will do my best to answer.Edit: Answering questions that I saw some of you asking1) Got the gpu from a Greek retailer. I live in Greece.2) Paid about 3000 euros for the build.3) Fan configuration is top-bottom: intake back-side:exhaustWhy is it the best for o11? Well I watched this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX8S_hzW1uc4) No this is not my only drive lolhttps://imgur.com/a/vm8ZXQd5) Haven't Oc'ed yet.6) Yeah a 750W psu is enough as long as you go with a good quality one and don't cheat out.7) Do I need a sound card? No but a good pair of headphones + sound card/external dac makes a big difference compared to a gaming headset. There are also low impedance headphones which can be driven from the mobo directly but they won't sound as good. If you're curious and want to know more I suggest reading mad lust envy's guide:https://www.head-fi.org/threads/mad-lust-envys-headphone-gaming-guide-9-21-2020-sennheiser-pc38x-review-added.534479/8) Apparently running the rtx 3080 on pcie 3.0 x8 instead of x16 only has a tiny performance hit like 4-5%. So I think I will not be bothering with relocating my sound card using a riser cable which probably wouldn't fit between the 3080 and the pcie x1 slot anyway. I only feel kinda bad because the sound card is blocking the 3080's air pathway but oh well can't have it all.9) After contacting Asus they were able to verify that according to my motherboard's S/N I have the Intel® I225-V Β3 chip. :)"
"I forgot to plug the CPU power cables in. Woopsie."
"I just feel like I should thank each and every person on this sub since you all have helped me so much accomplish the dream I've had since I was a little kid.A year and a half ago I was really scared of computing I really wanted to fulfill my wish of playing all the games I wanted to experience without having to care on what platform they were on or without having to care about the price (since consoles LOVE not dropping prices below 35$ and I can't spend that kind of money). But I was scared of all of the implications it meant to build a PC and I didn't want to buy a prebuilt one since they were too expensive. I was scared of breaking something of choosing the wrong parts of wasting all the money I had been saving for 5 years.But when I encountered this sub everything changed for me. You all showed me that computing is not a wizard's trait and that I too could learn how to do it without much problem. Your advice helped me differentiate between good parts and bad parts it helped me understand how to build a long lasting pc. And what's best you helped me build my first pc with an incredible budget. With no more than 400$ (and some spare parts I could use from some pc's that my workplace was throwing out) we managed to pull of a PC that run almost every game in mid at 60FPS.I felt like a kid again playing GTA V with my friends again playing classics like Fallout Bioshock and DOOM and also being capable of playing competitively some games like Rainbow Six and CSGO. You can't even begin to comprehend how much it also helped me to keep my studies afloat during quarantine thanks to having a PC I could work much more efficentely and get shit done quick.It's been almost a year since I've had this pc and I can't be grateful enough for everything you all have made me accomplish. Thanks to all of you for making my dream come true and thank you for introducing me to a lovely community and one of my new favorite hobbies.  EDIT: Some are asking for the specs so here they are.

A case my workplace threw out.  Total = Roughly 450$I just now bought another 2 sticks of 4GB and it works fucking marvelous. Really happy with the build although looking back I would have opted for a better GPU since I'm having some performance issues with newer games."
"It was probably one of the most terrifying things ive ever done. But dam it sure helped.Borderlands 3 used to make the GPU run at about 83-85 degrees with the fan speed at Over 3k rpm (aka jet engine) Now it runs at about 70 degrees and 2200 RPM. I think it even lowered my CPU temp a smidge too just from being cooler.Just wanted to get that out there feeling pretty good about my temps for once!"

"how big will this difference actually be"
"Hello everyone hope you're having a good day because I am not.So recently I just got a PC with a RX 5600 XT Ryzen 5 3600. Today I was just casually using the PC and gave me a bluescreen when playing Stardew Valley like my 4th BsoD in all the time I had it ( it lasted 4 days ). So me and my brother tried to update the vBios since it this card is known for having some problems with drivers and bios. When we updated the BIOS it asked to me restart ( and we made a really bad mistake use update live 6 total installer because we wanted to update the motherboard's bios too ). And when it restart there was no display and the keyboard lights weren't on either. We tried many things such as putting back the bios that came from fabric clearing the CMOS changing the PCIE slot of the GPU and more. But nothing worked and when we look at the motherboard there are so lights that indicate if all the components are working or not when it comes to the GPU the light is always active meaning that it isn't being detected or working properly. We think it was about updating the vBIOS to the latest ones but we are not sure. I don't own a APU so I can't really do nothing about it. Waited years for it to work 4 days. Anyone has any thoughts of what it could be? And if it will still have warranty or not after updating the vBIOS.Thank you for reading.. I hope someone can help.Edit note: RX 5600 XT model was Mech OC.Edit 2: The problem was solved! People that are with the same problem this can help you. It turns out that we think that BIOS was incorrectly installed! So what we did was grab the RX 570 of my brother place both of the cards on mine and installed the vBIOS once again through AMDvbflash and it works now! Thank you for all the people that tried to help me!Edit 3: As you could see I learned the hard way NEVER use MSI Live Update 6 use and external website like TechPowerUp. MSI Live Update 6 is not good trust me.Edit 4: Thanks for everyone's support! I swear this subreddit has the best community for sure!Edit 5: If you own a RX 5600 XTI reccommend you to check this post | https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/gv7kqu/warning_to_rx_5600_xt_owners/"
"My parents think I will not be able to pick the right parts and that I will not be able to assemble the pc on my own. I always say that I know what I am doing but they dont trust/believe me what can I do?Edit: I am paying for this pc with my own money"

"I've had my computer together for about two years. I7-8700k @5.01ghz and a evga 1080ti SC2 21:9 120hz 1440p monitor. Recently my games began to run terrible. The other night it reached a tipping point for me and I decided to look through settings and make sure I had things optimized. I opened up intel tuning utility because once before some updates had wiped my overclock settings. Ram and CPU were all set correctly but I saw that I was hitting thermal throttling which I never hit under load. I opened up SIV (gigabytes fan program) and evga X1. My fan profiles for my cpu and gpu had gotten switched to stealth/quiet profiles at some point either accidently by me or via program updates. I made some custom aggressive performance profiles and performance went from 10-60 fps in warzone to 80-120 fps. I had been living with this for probably weeks or months assuming that game updates were making the game run slower. Tl;dr - if your computer isn't running to your expectations check the fan profiles and that your ram/cpu overclock haven't been lost."
"I've wanted to design and build my very own Lego Computer for a long time and so 9 weeks and 5000 Lego pieces later I finally finished it![Lego Computer](http://imgur.com/a/1AH2B)&nbsp;**My build has the following inside:**Asus Z170-ACore i7-6700KSamsung EVO 850 1TBEVGA GeForce GTX 1070 SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black EditionEVGA SuperNOVA 650 G2Kingston HyperX FURY 16GB&nbsp;The parts (including the peripherals such as a Wi-Fi card) totalled ~$1.4k the case was about $500. &nbsp;On the thermals the CPU runs at around 60-70 Celsius while under max stress (Prime95) and GPU at 70-80 Celsius (3DMark). The ambient temperature in the case from the two stress tests goes to about 50 Celsius. When playing games at top settings the temperatures rarely go anywhere near those numbers. Plus I spread the heat sources (PSU CPU GPU) around the case with each of the three fans blowing air across them. &nbsp;EDIT:I have another album where I took pictures of the progress. I didn't detail some parts of it because I got so engrossed with the construction that I forgot. :PAlso I didn't use glue or any adhesive at all looking at all the comments below. Just all Lego and PC hardware.http://imgur.com/a/3MUb7"
"Or just me?Saved the money to build a pc and then COVID19 happened and I was advised to just wait and then see what happens when new shit comes out so I'm just living through y'all right nowEdit: - what are some companies that make quality shit?

I don't care for a fancy looking one but one that makes building a pc easier for me and for making adjustments in the future"

"16yo daughter wanted a PC to replace her 4yo laptop which wasn't really cutting it any more for all  the games she wanted to play. So joint Nov birthday/xmas  present PCCriteria was a machine that could play the games she plays now decently at 1080p (mostly lots of esports stuff it seems like Rainbow Siege Minecraft who knows what else I can't keep up :-) )  cope with some more demanding stuff and with scope for upgrading.  that would hopefully last say at least 5 years before the underlying performance limits start to biteAlso looking cool and with a good dose of RGB of course.Of course this autumn was not a good time to be planning this so some compromises were made due to price and availability. E.G. the GPU.  but also got some decent prices on some things as well.  But we are happy with the build.She did most of the build herself (helped me last year with one) with occasional help and guidance from me. Not quite happy with the Phanteks Neon RGB strip as had issues with the fixing and it needs redoing. And whilst not an RGB fan really myself I do think it looks pretty sleek the white sleeved extensions really make a difference/. The fans are a little on the noisy side for me but she doesn't care as has  a headset on most of the time.  She bought a Razer keyboard and Logitech mouse to go with it. Using a decent (Dell Ultrasharp) but standard 24 inch monitor.  This will probably get upgraded at some future date but it's way better than her laptop screen :-)[A few pics here](https://imgur.com/a/W8EZeD4)Part list below[PCPartPicker Part List](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/G4VmNP)|Type|Item|Price||:-|:-|:-||**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 5 3600XT 3.8 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/7sFKHx/amd-ryzen-5-3600xt-38-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000281box)|Purchased For £225.00||**Motherboard**|[MSI MPG B550 GAMING EDGE WIFI ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/2f4BD3/msi-mpg-b550-gaming-edge-wifi-atx-am4-motherboard-mpg-b550-gaming-edge-wifi)|Purchased For £112.99||**Memory**|[Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/QDhKHx/corsair-vengeance-rgb-pro-16gb-2-x-8gb-ddr4-3200-memory-cmw16gx4m2c3200c16)|Purchased For £68.99||**Storage**|[Western Digital Blue SN550 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/BhmFf7/western-digital-blue-sn550-1-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-wds100t2b0c)|Purchased For £79.99||**Storage**|[Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/mwrYcf/seagate-barracuda-computer-2-tb-35-7200rpm-internal-hard-drive-st2000dm008)|Purchased For £47.39||**Video Card**|[XFX Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB THICC II Pro Video Card](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/DNgQzy/xfx-radeon-rx-5500-xt-8-gb-thicc-ii-pro-video-card-rx-55xt826d6)|Purchased For £199.99||**Case**|[Phanteks Eclipse P360A ATX Mid Tower Case](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/ZJcRsY/phanteks-eclipse-p360a-atx-mid-tower-case-ph-ec360atg_dbk)|Purchased For £65.80||**Power Supply**|[Corsair RMx 550 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/3zNypg/corsair-power-supply-cp9020090na)|Purchased For £76.99||**Operating System**|[Microsoft Windows 10 Pro OEM 64-bit](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/MfH48d/microsoft-os-fqc08930)|Purchased For £9.99||**Case Fan**|[Metallic Gear Skiron 50 CFM 120 mm Fan](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/rLwkcf/metallic-gear-skiron-d-rgb-120-50-cfm-120-mm-fan-mg-f120pdrgb_bk)|Purchased For £10.88||**Custom**|[Phanteks Neon Digital RGB LED Strip - 550mm](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/3fyqqs/phanteks-neon-digital-rgb-led-strip-550mm)|Purchased For £13.55||**Custom**|[EZDIY-FAB PSU Cable Extension Sleeved Custom Mod GPU PC Power Supply Soft Nylon Braided with Comb Kit 24PIN/8PIN to 6+2Pin/ 8PIN to 4+4PIN-30CM 300MM - White](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/4yrYcf/placeholder-)|£25.99 @ Amazon UK||*Prices include shipping taxes rebates and discounts*||||**Total**|**£937.55**|||Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-12-20 11:27 GMT+0000|||&#x200B;"

"Hey builders!Effective immediately I will no longer be on the mod team here at /r/buildapc. As we speak I am packing up for the 25+ hour drive to Texas tomorrow. Why? I am fortunate enough to say that I have taken a job at [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com/) helping /u/manirelli with his duties and working on some new functionality you guys will really like. I've been hanging around /r/buildapc since it was a few months old (5 years ago!). In my time moderating I believe I'm more qualified than anyone else to say that despite growing to quite a large size for such a niche subreddit the community has been fantastic.The rare occasions someone has asked me what it's like moderating /r/buildapc the first thing I've always said was that you guys make it *easy*. While there are always some bad eggs the vast majority of you have been a pleasure to work with. Everyone looks out for each other and for us as a mod team. We really have been fortunate to have the community's support in such an ample manner all these years.Please do keep contributing to the subreddit. Please do keep maintaining respectful interactions with the humans on the other side of the keyboard. And please do keep making /r/buildapc a pleasure to moderate. While I think /r/buildapc has one of the best mod teams out there both for mods and for users an important part of that has been having one of the best communities.I'm super excited for this next phase of my life; I'm glad I got to take this ride with you guys. You can bet I'll still be around the subreddit and you can always reach me on [our IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/irc).Be excellent to each other[Alex AKA ThoughtA](http://i.imgur.com/Gz3t9lB.jpg)^^^^and ^^^^Eowyn##Edit: Also AMAEdit 2: I am alive.

"Letter [here](https://imgur.com/a/l6C9Mi2).Really wanting to help this kid with at least one part.Edit for those thinking it's a con:  My wife's first reaction was the same and I firmly believe a dose of skepticism is healthy.  So let's assume worst case scenario it's a scam and I buy this kid (adult?) a part or two.  I've contributed to something that I believe to be an admirable cause-a kid looking to get into PC-building and tinkering.   A kid who wants to BUILD something themselves rather than buy it and have the work done for them.  A kid who clearly isn't asking for top of the line shit and just wants parts to build a damn PC.  If it goes to an adult instead then well I've still done a good thing with admirable intentions and if that's how someone scams me out of $30 or so dollars then so be it I guess.  But fuck that person and may karma rain down upon them.If you think it's a scam by me please by all means have a look at my post history."
"I built a PC this summer and it was a fantastic experience. I learned a lot I felt a sense of accomplishment when it was complete (are they every fully complete?) and it was an overall upgraded experience using it for work and play. I thought it was pretty good but I had no idea. I'm housesitting for some friends for the next three days so I just brought along the laptop I was using before my build so that I could work and still have a computer available. It's pretty much the first time that I've used it since June. The difference that seemed like "a pretty good upgrade" before now feels like the difference between a horse and buggy and a Ferrari. Having a dedicated GPU vs. integrated graphics having an SSD vs. an HDD having a 24" monitor vs. a 14" laptop screen- the list goes on and on. Distance definitely makes the heart grow fonder and I will appreciate my PC that much more once I'm back home."

"I'm 16 in high school so I've met a few people that have built pcs like I have. When we've talked about it though and I describe my build to them (R3 1200 GTX 960 4gb 8gb 3000 ram) they immediately seem dismissive of it just because it's cheaper than the i7s and SLI 1080s they have. I searched for parts for about 6 months on a fixed budget of 550$. I don't have a job then and that was Christmas + birthday money saved. I ended up buying almost half of my parts used and ended up with something I'm very happy with (totalling ~$750 USD new). Now I have a job and will upgrade soon after I get a car but until then I will just get the same response from other PCMR members I guess.Edit: [here's my build](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/7v2elr/my_first_pc_build_rip_budget_right_now/?utm_source=reddit-android)Edit 2: why TF did this blow up lol?

This was done fairly easily with a USB boot drive with [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/).  I've been using and transferring Ubuntu from one system to another over the years since I started with [Hardy Heron](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/hardy/release/) As a result my faithful Ubuntu 22.04 was in BIOS not UEFI.  This turned out to be a problem.  **Intel onboard graphics now require UEFI.**      So **I had to convert my drive to UEFI.**  I did this by using [gparted](https://gparted.org/) to move the partitions over to leave room to create a UEFI boot partition.  (Let me know if you want more details about this.)  Then I used an Ubuntu installation USB drive with [boot-repair](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair/) to create a new GRUB.  (Ubuntu users will know what that is.)  Could I just use a Boot-Repair USB drive and not load it on a Ubuntu installation drive?  Nope Boot-Repair could not find the internet connection and it would not function without it.  So the Ubuntu USB was needed to establish the connection.    All good?  No.  I failed to turn off fast-boot in the MSI motherboard.  **An undocumented feature of this motherboard is that the USB keyboard will not get power until the UEFI fast-boot process is over** which means that it is impossible to smash the DEL key during boot to get to the BIOS.  This required a reset of the motherboard to get into the BIOS to let the system know that there is DDR4 3600Mhz RAM rather than the smaller RAM allocated by default and for other settings as well.   All good?  No.  **By resetting the BIOS Ubuntu's UEFI no longer matched that of the motherboard.** This kicked up a UEFI secure boot shim error and Ubuntu would not boot.So I went back into BIOS and turned off the secure boot.  All good?  Yes about 4 hours later.   Thanks to all for your help in this adventure.  The next step is to use my recently purchased (new in box from a thrift shop) Epson Perfection V600 Photo scanner and start scanning old family photos  with my cat.**EDIT**  **This computer is dead quiet.**  The power supply fan probably will never turn on by design.  The other fans are nearly inaudible and it's right next to my desk as you can see from the pictures.  I'm using OpenRGB and it works fine with this MSI Board. The previous bug in OpenRGB which used to brick the MSI RGB system was fixed a while ago."
"In the past 2 days ***FOUR*** medium sized spiders have crawled from the "area" my PC sits in and along the wall all of a similar color and body shape. Seeing as how they've all appeared from the same area even after killing one and disposing of it in the toilet I believe that it is possible that there is a nest somewhere in my PC as my desk is clear of any spiderwebs and there isn't a crack in the wall down there or anything.If anybody's experienced with this what do you do to potentially clear it out? I don't wanna open it and have a hundred of these guys in my house either.&#x200B;edit: thanks for all the dad jokes and screw the people telling me to "man up" or "grow a pair." I'm gonna wait until later today and take it outside and open up the back panel. I might film it or take pictures. I'll make an update post and link it here if anything conclusive happens.edit2: you can find the update post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/hrf1s4/the\_rather\_disappointing\_spider\_infestation\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/hrf1s4/the_rather_disappointing_spider_infestation_update/) "

"After securing a 3070 on launch day I inevitably used up all my luck. My first build would randomly repost. I tried everything within my limited understanding of PCs to troubleshoot. Swapped PSU's and MOBO's ran memtest86 reinstalled windows countless times. Even had a buddy send me a separate SSD with windows installed and the latest 3070 driver.After 2 months I finally realized that paired with Kernel power 41 was a WHEA error detailing a Cache Hierarchy error with my Ryzen 5 3600. I RMA'd that immediately and AMD sent me a replacement. So far I've had no issues for the past day. Gonna hold my breath for the next week and hope my build doesn't explode haha!Edit:A little clarification. When I say that the Kernel Power 41 error is "paired" with a WHEA error this means both errors would occur within 2-5 seconds of each other. I'd get a black screen repost situation. When I'd get back into windows event viewer would report the Critical Kernel Power error and then the WHEA logger error. This stands for Window Hardware Error Architecture and it's a framework designed to alert if a piece of fundamental hardware is faulty. For Me the details of my error were this: "A fatal hardware error has occurred. Component: Processor Core. Error source: Machine Check Exception. Error Type: Cache Hierarchy. And then it would list which Core was experiencing the issue. While I don't know 100% how a CPU functions I know that Cache Hierarchy is fundamental to the successful function of the CPU itself. I explained this exactly to AMD and they approved the RMA without further questions.   I appreciate everyone's comments and Silver awards too!Edit 2: holy crap this blew up!!! This sub is freaking amazing though. I appreciate all the kind words. And to those that are discouraged about building a PC it was very daunting for me initially. And I was SO dejected and frustrated when I didn't have a working build. Troubleshooting is one of THE most difficult aspects of building a PC especially for first time builders like myself. But again there's a whole breadth of resources online to help (including this sub)... although I can definitely say that I wish there was a straight forward troubleshooting guide to assist us newbies. Unfortunately troubleshooting isn't that straight forward. So I'd encourage everyone to do a bit of research on how a PC functions normally maybe a get a refresher on some computer science topics and some general electrical knowledge too before the build. Learn a bit on how each component like RAM CPU etc work together. I learned a TON while troubleshooting and figuring out what is what while building too. This way if you encounter some issues you can have a rough  idea why your PC crashed or black-screened enough to do some research or get better direction. Don't get discouraged!!Cheers!"
"It's getting scary. I'm seeing more and more people bringing up CPUboss comparisons and it scares me to think some could make a purchase based off their results. I had some poor guy thinking a 3230m was better than an i3-6100 😣 http://hwbench.com/cpus/intel-core-i5-3230m-vs-intel-core-i3-6100I'm not saying everything that site says is false but for beginners they just look at the gold lines. If you actually read the facts it gives about each chip you might find the 6100 is better. But it's just pointless to use that site when you have ones like **UserBenchmark** and **HWBench**.Edit: Anandtech is indeed another great option that I didn't mention and was brought up in comments. And also remember to use ALL of these sites before making a decision/argument as it's not _impossible_ for one of the sites  to have a mistake every once in a while.Edit: Bolding websites I mentioned as I'm seeing lots of people aren't noticing them.Edit: I'm also seeing some confusion concerning the link I used. The link I used isn't the website the poor man was confused about that's CPUboss. The link I used was from a good website to show that the 6100 is the clear winner but also gives reasons to consider the other CPU such as low TDP. But unlike CPUboss HWBench doesn't let that weigh in on which CPU is _better_ it just lists it as the advantages that CPU has over the other. I hope this clears things up!"

"I lost use of my left arm when I was as very young.  I have been building PCs since I was a teenager.  Having taught myself to build PCs one armed I have always had a solid understanding of why things need to be assembled a certain way not just how to assemble them.  This led me to be able to help others learn as they struggled in tech school and subsequently helped me teach less experienced technicians when I used to do desktop support.  To this day I still build and upgrade my PCs one armed.  Usually a build takes about an hour.  Don't let an injury or disability stop you from building...build on"
" Checked my email and saw that I was picked for a 3070.  Tried to checkout and the link had expired 15 minutes earlier. Gutted. The wait continues."
"I woke up on Christmas to find that my 8 year old shitty work computer had been replaced with a high end gaming pc (and a new monitor!). I want to make sure this computer last so ive been doing research and there seems to be a lot of people saying putting your pc on the floor will have it attract more dust and reduce airflow. I wanted to know if this is true ( btw i have my pc on a wooden floor)."
"So I mixed up my power cords for my screen and PC. Does which one is which matter (can I plug either into the PC or screen)? If not how do I figure out which is which?"
"HiSince I cannot crosspost here I will repost my original post from r/nvidia. This post is for everyone who has considered buying an OLED 4k TV from LG to game on with the RTX 3080. I'm not trying to get tech support here but rather try to get attention for this issue so LG or Nvidia will fix this.I have recently bought an 48" LG OLED CX for the 4k 120Hz HDR gaming experience on the RTX 3080. Since I haven't been able to get a RTX 3080 yet a friend of mine brought his Zotac RTX 3080 over to my house to test and experience the 4k 120Hz TV. Well... it's been a pretty big disappointment. We experienced the following.&#x200B;* The LG CX will automatically chroma subsample at 4k 120Hz meaning you will get 4:2:2 instead of 4:4:4. Everything is fine at 4k 60Hz. But at 4k 120Hz we noticed something is wrong with the colors. The chroma subsampling is clearly evident when looking at the borders of dark text. This is not some small issue because it pretty much ruins the 4k 120Hz experience once you notice it.* 4k 60Hz 1440p 120Hz seem to be 4:4:4 with no subsampling.* We researched online and there are numerous reports confirming this chroma subsampling issue at 4k 120 Hz. (sources: [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/page-74](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/page-74) [https://hardforum.com/threads/lg-48cx.1991077/page-103](https://hardforum.com/threads/lg-48cx.1991077/page-103)) Apparently only the CX models are affected for the C9 models 4k 120 Hz 4:4:4 is working fine. I couldn't find a single piece of evidence that the LG CX is capable of 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 with an HDMI 2.1 input.* Since other TV models are not affected I doubt this is Nvidia's fault. It more points toward LG's side. When reading through the forums it looks like this internal downsampling issue of an 4:4:4 input to 4:2:2 has been an issue for months nothing has been done yet to fix it . It is even questionable if LG is aware of this and whether they will ever fix this.* If this is a software bug and is fixable by LG this might get fixed if we bring enough attention to it. However if this is a hardware bug (meaning the LG CX has never been capable of 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 with HDMI 2.1) I highly doubt this will get fixed before PS5 release and release of Cyberpunk 77 (or ever). I have yet to see a single piece of evidence that the LG CX is even capable of 4k 120 Hz 4:4:4 ...* G-Sync is completely bugged. We were forced to turn it off.Until this issue and the Gsync issue (which is most likely on Nvidia's side and will be fixed with the new driver update) is resolved do not buy the LG CX if you are expecting a true 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 experience it is not acceptable with the 4:2:2 issue and you should not spend 1.5k or even 2k+ USD/Euro on this TV until LG has fixed this.I have found a real image of a LG CX monitor with this issue from another forum that really shows how much a problem the chroma subsampling is (4k 120Hz 10bit all pictures taken by Sixi82 from the avsforum I am not taking any credit for them and solely using them to help resolve this issue):no subsampling:[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k60-jpg.3038320/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k60-jpg.3038320/)[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/img\_4723-jpg.3038322/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/img_4723-jpg.3038322/)[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k60\_1-jpg.3038325/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k60_1-jpg.3038325/)with subsampling:[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k120-jpg.3038326/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k120-jpg.3038326/)[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/img\_4724-jpg.3038327/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/img_4724-jpg.3038327/)[https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k120\_1-jpg.3038328/](https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/4k120_1-jpg.3038328/)&#x200B;credit: [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60110685](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60110685)You will especially notice this in PC mode when you play a game with text. The text just becomes a blurry smeary mess at close distance it's like having the wrong prescriptions for your glasses. At this price point 1.5k - 2.5k USD/Euro this is just unacceptable. There is no point of using this TV as gaming monitor if text becomes smeary at 4k 120Hz and even 100Hz and every other framerate other than 60Hz according to some in the forums.Apparently LG decided to cut the HDMI 2.1 transfer rate from 48 Gbits/s to 40 Gbits/s. But still 40 Gbits/s is still enough for 4k 120Hz 4:4:4 HDR (only needs about 32 Gbits/s for 4k 120Hz 4:4:4).&#x200B;EDIT:I just want to clarify why this issue should not be considered some small inconvenience for LG and Nvidia but rather an important issue that might decide over massive future revenues:* The LG OLED CX will be a groundbreaking and a class definiting "monitor": first TV to support 4k 120Hz AND 4:4:4AND G-Sync AND HDR. This has never been done before. Unlike other 4k OLED models this makes the LG CX perfect for gamers.* Gaming on the LG OLED CX is from another world. Breathtaking colors strong contrasts low input lag. And all with features tailored towards gamers (G-Sync high refreshrate). When i first tried the LG CX it opened my eyes. I had a matrix moment where I decided that I take the truth pill. I cannot ever go back to a non-OLED display. If you have never experienced that you must try it it is nothing like you have ever experienced.* If this chroma subsampling issue and G-Sync issue is not resolved this will definitely break the LG CX for gamers it is nothing more than an ordinary OLED TV then.* LG and Nvidia might potentially lose a huge market. I can totally imagine a future where gamer enthusiast's first monitor choice is an OLED monitor with G-Sync because it offers everything an IPS monitor has but with better colors contrast HDR and so on.* The revenue and profit margins on the OLED monitors will be probably much higher than the current IPS/TN/VA monitors and might lead to a significant revenue stream for Nvidia and LG.&#x200B;EDIT 2:Things I have/others have tried to fix it:* Switch HDMI cables. I have tried with 2 different HDMI 2.1 cables (50 Euro each) that support up to 8k 60Hz* Switch between all kinds of different modes: SDR/HDR PC Mode 8 bit 10 bit done nearly everything.* G-Sync seem to work again when going back to an older driver version with RTX 2000 or older series.* Chroma subsampling primarily (or only) affects the LG OLED CX and becomes noticable at 4k 120Hz 100Hz and 1080p 120Hz. 4k 60Hz and 1440p 120Hz are fine.I just hope we bring enough attention towards these 2 issues. They will either make or break the OLED gaming monitor. If this issues persist the OLED gaming monitor market will probably die in its infancy and will never recover.Although the B9 and C9 models do not have the chroma subsampling issues (don't take my word for it) the current model and only not discontinued model the CX has this issue which makes it quite important to fix it quickly with all the new RTX 3080 owners who want to upgrade soon with Cyberpunk 77 and other game releases&#x200B;EDIT 3:John Archer just covered these issues on Forbes[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2020/09/20/lg-oled-tvs-having-issues-with-latest-nvidia-rtx-30-graphics-cards/#513a5d57267a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2020/09/20/lg-oled-tvs-having-issues-with-latest-nvidia-rtx-30-graphics-cards/#513a5d57267a)&#x200B;EDIT 4:[/u/true-logixx](https://www.reddit.com/u/true-logixx/) pointed out a small fix for the subsampling problem: Turn HDR on and Pixelshift off (3840x2160 120Hz 10bit PC Mode). It still looks scuffed and subsampled but a little less than without HDR. Not sure what type of subsampling this is. Settings: [https://imgur.com/CXZUZoX](https://imgur.com/CXZUZoX)&#x200B;EDIT 5: To counterclaim that the HDMI cable is the issue ([https://twitter.com/BigJohnnyArcher/status/1307760577775915008](https://twitter.com/BigJohnnyArcher/status/1307760577775915008)) : I think the strongest argument against that is that C9 has no subsampling whereas the CX subsamples with the same HDMI cable (DP to HDMI 2.1 adapter) and setup:(see people who testet that: [/u/kasakka1](https://www.reddit.com/u/kasakka1/) [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113799](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113799)  [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113596](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/2020-lg-cx%E2%80%93gx-dedicated-gaming-thread-consoles-and-pc.3138274/post-60113596))" Its not cable related. Atleast not for me. Tested 3 "8K" "4k120" UltraHighSpeed HDMI 48GBps Cables from different. All with the same result as described in the article. therefor i believe the signal is transported as it should be from GPU to OLED. " Sixi82 Twitter" I own both a CX 48 and C9 65. Using the Club3D DP 1.4 + DSC -> HDMI 2.1 adapter on v1.03 firmware with a 2080 Ti:* C9 is ok at 4K 60 Hz 4K 120 Hz in both SDR and HDR. Full RGB no issues.* CX is ok at 4K 60 Hz SDR/HDR.* CX is ok at 1440p 120 Hz SDR/HDR. For some reason. The res/refresh rate combo is listed separate in the display EDID no other 120 Hz resolution is shown like this.* CX is ok at 1080p 60 Hz.* CX is *not* *ok* at 1080 120 Hz.* CX is *not ok* at 4K 120 Hz SDR. It downsamples to 4:2:2.* CX is *not ok* at 4K 120 Hz HDR. It looks fine but there is something off about the colors when looking at the Rtings.com test pattern colors look more muted somehow but in normal use the difference is hard to see. There seems to be a very slight difference in sharpness compared to 4K 60 Hz." by [laxu](https://www.avsforum.com/members/laxu.8233782/)It also doesn't seem like that people who supposedly got the LG OLED CX to work have gotten any special kind of HDMI cable:[**The Tech Chap**@TheTechChap](https://twitter.com/TheTechChap) reply to [@landongwright](https://twitter.com/landongwright)"They're all much the same really. I just searched hdmi 2.1 on Amazon and picked one"&#x200B;EDIT 6: u/fanslo had a chat with LG support ([original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED/comments/ix2mcu/lg_chat_reply_regarding_lg_cx_4k_120hz_444_issues/)). The LG support stated that their engineers are working on it. They promised to either fix this with a firmware update or replace the TV if they can't solve the subsampling issue. I'm not sure however if this can be seen as a guarantee that LG will fix it or replace your TV or if this is just a standard answer.EDIT 7: LG confirmed that they will roll out an update that will fix the G-Sync issues and maybe the subsampling issue (not explicitly mentioned). Yay. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DRWe-5o8s&ab\_channel=HDTVTest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DRWe-5o8s&ab_channel=HDTVTest). "LG has been made aware that some LG OLED TVs are experiencing certain compatibility issues with the recently launched Nvidia RTX 30 Series graphics card. An updated firmware has been in development with plans for a roll out within the next few weeks to LG's 2020 and 2019 HDMI 2.1 capable TVs which should address these incompatibility issues. When ready additional information will be available on the LG website and in the software update section of owners' LG TVs.

"https://m.imgur.com/a/PYNzngZI've been gaming on an 2009 HP desktop since well....2009. For the past few years I've been just playing CSGO since it's the only thing it could handle that I found fun.  I've wanted a better pc however so i could stream and play more games.  Finally back in September I got a dishwashing job (I'm 18 as a senior in high school) to save up money for my dream i7 + 1080 build. Dishwashing fucking sucks.  It's overworking ur not really respected by anyone in or out of the job and I just wanted to quit every shift.  But my motivation to be able to have a sick pc that can stream and to prove my stingy dad wrong that "I can't build a computer because I don't know enough". So i just bit my tongue and suffered thru it.  My club advisor recommended me to buy parts over time if they went on sale so i got a 1080 in october for like $470 and then just kept budgeting my small paychecks and collecting from there. I spent months staying up till like 2-3 AM on school nights to watch tutorials and PC building videos. And lurking on this sub whenever i was chilling outside to find mistakes and problems ppl run into so I could study.  And finally in March I have everything and now it's spring break and time to build. Sunday i spent half the day cleaning under my nasty ass desk to disassemble the old pc and make my gaming station look as clean as possible.And today (Monday) was build day.  My mom actually made me do laundry before i started building and i got so paranoid of static i was wiping my hands and arms on anything metal i could find lol. And then noon rolled around and i started building on our small kitchen countertop (my room is fully carpeted desk is already fully cleaned and has my keyboard mouse and monitor waiting for new pc to hook up). I wore slippers (I live in Hawaii Flip-flops for the rest of u lol) to protect myself from static whenever I had to walk on carpet to see the back side.And it took 9. Fucking. Hours. Whoever said PC building is really easy is a liar. (Jk it's my first time and I just suck but I just gotta vent a bit).  CPU installation onto the motherboard was the most terrifying experience ever. The retention arm took so much force to pull down it scared the shit out of me.  Installing the fully modular supply wasnt too bad but for some reason only the bottom two holes could be screwed in not the top two cuz there wasnt proper alignment with the case to screw them. Ah still held strong and secure tho. I then laid down the case on the PSU cables (installing the psu first was a mistake i blame Paul lol jk) which seemed sketch to install the mobo.It took like 45 MINUTES to install the mobo into the case. The standoffs would NOT line up it was an extremely tight fit in the case. I had to remove both fans on the h500i to put it in. A screw even got dropped and wedged under this small thingy on the mobo and i had to use a used toothpick to pry it out. Finally tho it all lined up and i got it down and could finally lift the case off the PSU cables. Then the nzxt kraken x62 aio. I knew from a long time ago it would be kinda complicated to install but holy shit was it frustrating. Lining up and screwing the stupid radiator bracket fans and radiator for indirect mounting was the hardest shit ever. And even after i finished that 40 min later i had to take it all apart again cuz the STUPID radiator bracket was too high for the thumbscrew so I had to readjust the whole thing so it would be lower. Took me an hour for just installing the indirect radiator/fans Installing the pump was pretty stressful too but i could do it quicker in like 15 mins. I forgot to mention too that i had like almost zero lighting the whole time apart from the shitty ceiling kitchen light.  I had to constantly use my phone flashlight and heavy duty flashlight to see into my ALSO black case/mobo. Plugging in all the cables wasnt too bad but routing some of them like the CPU power was a pain. And cable managing in the back was kind of a pain too. Lots of cables would get stuck under the cable bar and it was a total mess. I forgot there was velcros tho in the back lol.Texted my friend saying ive been working for 7 hours and he said he built his first time in 2 hours lol. He's not being toxic or anything but still lol.Installing the drives was another pain. The SSD wasnt too hard since it could attach above the PSU shroud but connecting the SATA data cables was a pain cuz i didnt know which end went where (like the L shaped plug). Hoping it didnt really matter so i plugged the flat end into the SSD and the L shape into the mobo and routed it so it could plug in and hide.  Then the HDD. I got the second data cable and OH LOOK THEYRE BOTH FLAT ENDED. But i had already painfully cable managed the SSD cable so i wasnt replugging it.  And i checked the manual how to get the drive cage out.  IT SAYS IT USES THE SAME SCREWS FOR THE DRIVE CAGE AND SECURING THE HDD. But theyre not the drive cage has bigger flatter ends so u can secure it and u use the same screws as the mobo to secure the hdd. I spent an hour confused as to why the tiny SSD screws i had mistakenly thought could be used to install the HDD as well werent securing the drive cage. Took an hour to install the HDD (I know im retarded).Then the GPU. It actually wasnt too bad however it was really big and a tight fit inside my case.  I forgot there was a guard on the GPU however so i spent 5 mins wondering why tf wasnt it going in? Was it actually not compatible? Then i was like "oh im stupid" and took the guard off.And then everything had pretty much been done just a bit of cable managing to make sure no fans hit cables and the back panel could close (just push the cables in lol no ones gonna see it).I took a break cuz i hadnt eaten in 9 hours and braced myself for failure test booting it. I hit the power button and i saw a red light and everything shut off. I wasnt really suprised. And then a red and then orange light and i was like "wait wtf" and then a green light the case lit up and screen display showed and i actually screamed in joy lol.  Finally feels like all my meaningless work ive put in for the past 6 months has finally paid off and im so excited to finally have my very own creation to game on! AND HOLY SHIT SSD'S ARE INSANE IT LITERALLY TAKES LESS THAN 30 SECONDS TO BOOT UP WINDOWS. I'm so used to turning on the pc and having to wait like half an hour for the pc to configure warmup etc.Sorry for this long ass post/rant lol im just really happy and wanted to just vent and thank this amazing subreddit for really helping me out. Huge thanks to Bitwit Paul and Joey Delgado for all the amazing content they put out.Yes i know my cable management is..... mediocre. But im really happy it came out nonetheless.Quick questionsIs it ok if the PSU is just held by the two bottom screws. Like i said the screwholes for the psu and case dont match up at the top and the only way to screw them is to put the screw thru the chain vent thingy. It feels strong anyway.Why does the power cable thing u plug into the kraken x62 pump (next to the usb) feel so loose? Like i made it so it felt sorta secure but a small tug or different angle of the cables and it just slips out.I enjoyed using CAM for the RGB setting on the pump and case (first time with RGB I love it its so aesthetically pleasing to look at and play with) However I have heard all the complaints about datamining and high network usage and shit. Is it ok to just always close it in the background? I would jusr open it for rgb setting and to check temps. Thanks for reading this long lol. TL:DR- Spent 6 months slaving away at a shitty dishwashing job spent 9 full hours straight building my pc and ran into a shit load of problems causing tons of frustration friend told me he did it in 2 hours his first time and finally booted up first try and fulfilled my long dream to a high end pc.Edit: Never expected this to blow up so much! Reading all the kind comments and compliments you guys have makes me so happy and really makes me feel even more proud of myself. Its 5 am now because i was commenting on everyones stuff but thankfully its spring break now XD. This is really becoming my favorite sub and all of you guys are awesome! Thank you so much *bow bow* Edit 2: My first Gold! Thank you guys so much :) So before going to sleep i still cant decide if i should invert the radiator. I REALLY dont want to go thru screwing it all back together especially now there's the gpu and the pump attached. Can u guys let me know if its REALLY necassary for the tubes to be on top or on bottom is ok?"

"I'm seeing a lot of misconceptions of Ryzen cpu's lately and just want to make a post about it so i can link people to it in the future.&nbsp;Ryzen CPU's are designed to run hot: https://i.imgur.com/3hkp7dV.jpgI see tons of people worried about temps on their Ryzens if its designed to run at certain temperatures you should trust that and have faith in the product you purchased. Heres a neat video showing that heat and heat transfer are very different things silicon is very durable stuff: https://youtu.be/Pp9Yax8UNoM&nbsp;Many people come from intel cpus and are surprised when using ryzen and the temps are often higher read on and have some faith in ryzen cpu's design.Ryzen is designed to auto overclock itself thats why you see a base clock and a boost clock listed. When PBO(performance boost overdrive) or auto oc is enabled in the bios Ryzen will automatically regulate itself to provide the best performance possible from the cpu it is very efficient at doing so it will always try to reach the height of its boost clock and will only throttle once it hits its target temperature threshold which is often around 80-90c.&nbsp;For example me and my friend both have a 5900x in our PC's the only difference is he has a 360mm AIO and i have a wraith prism on mine. When we stress test the cpu with PBO enabled both our temperatures hit 85-90c the only difference is his boost clock is able to reach over 5Ghz speeds while mine caps around 4.75Ghz. So when people are asking if a new cooler will bring their Ryzen temps down its not exactly how that works.&nbsp;The reason it works this way is because as explained above Ryzen with PBO enabled regulates itself its constantly changing voltages and clocks between all the cores to reach its maximum efficiency before hitting its target temp after once it does it'll start to throttle. If you are still uncomfortable with Ryzens designed temperatures then you can optionally disable PBO/Auto OC and do a manual all-core clock and set a manual voltage that way the voltage is locked and you can control what temperature you feel comfortable around in this case.. a better cooler WILL help. if we locked the 5900x at 4.04Ghz @ 1.08v on a wraith prism you might never go above 65c for example but on an AIO you might see temps even lower than that its because the voltage is locked and PBO isnt flucuating the voltages anymore so it makes sense that 2 different coolers will have varying temps at the same voltage.&nbsp;so basically to sum up the base and boost clock should be listed for each ryzen cpu if your boost speed isn't getting to its listed boost speeds then that's when you know you are being throttled by temps.. therefore a better cooler is needed to let it get to its listed boost potential and if the cooler is really good it may also bring the temps down after its reached its boost ceiling and have extra headroom to bring those temps down as well.&nbsp;Hope this helps explain a few things its up to you to decide if you prioritize speed or temperature.&nbsp;EDIT: didn't think this would get as much attention as it has something I might as well mention is to look into offsetting the voltage or undervolting with ryzen. because of the nature of ryzen and how it boosts you can actually negative offset the voltage which gives you lower temps but may see a higher clock boost due to the lower temps creating a situation where you're undervolting and lowering temps but getting better performance because of the boosting tech lol. there's tons of topics on it from a google search definitely worth reading into imo."
"\*\*\*WOW this post really blew up. I'm really grateful for all the great comments and awards. Thank you everyone. This was my second PC but I have been really getting more into the budget build route and so I'm glad other people are into that! Happy deal hunting :)**DISCLAIMER:** I sourced these used components over the last few weeks in my local area (SF Bay CA). Where I live there's a pretty good selection of used PC parts so your mileage will vary depending on where you live. But I just wanted to put it out there that many of you can definitely build a decent gaming PC for $200-400 if you are willing to spend the time to hunt for deals in your local area especially if you live in/near a metropolitan area.[pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z3gmMA5)**Parts List****CPU:** Intel Xeon e5 2620 v3 6 core/12 thread - **$16 eBay****Motherboard:** Asus Sabertooth X99 - **$85 Craigslist****CPU Cooler:** CoolerMaster Hyper 212 - **$20 OfferUp****Memory:** Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 2400 MHz (CPU reads a max of 1866) - **$40 OfferUp****Storage:** WD 640GB HDD 7200 rpm - **$10 Craigslist****GPU:** EVGA GTX 960 SC 4GB (I actually bought 2 at once for $75 on Facebook Marketplace sold one on eBay for $100 essentially GIVING me $15 (after eBay/PayPal fees) and a free GPU)**Case:** Phanteks prebuild case w/ 3 RGB Apevia fans - **$30 Craigslist****PSU:** Corsair CX600 - **$20 Facebook Marketplace****Total** (including the $15 I gained from selling the extra GPU):  **$206**I can happily play CS:GO Apex Legends Fortnite GTA V and many other games at 1080p at medium settings or better and get 60+ fps. With a better GPU and a little more money you wouldn't have any issues getting much higher FPS.So let's break down these components a little bit more and talk about which deals will be harder to replicate if you plan on doing something like this.Firstly the CPU is actually the easiest part to attain on this list. These can regularly be had for $20 off eBay. This particular X99 motherboard is VERY NICE for $85 (I actually got it for $70 but paid $15 for the OEM IO shield off eBay because it didn't come with one). It's a quality mobo with 8 slots for RAM so upgrading RAM on this will be as easy as buying another kit of the same capacity and as time goes by and RAM gets cheaper you could just keep doing that if you wanted without having to get rid of your previous RAM. But finding this exact motherboard for the price may be difficult.Luckily there are X99 motherboards being made out of China right now using recycled chipsets for about $60-120 depending on the particular models (available from AliExpress). Some of these motherboards are actually pretty good quality but definitely do your research first. I recommend checking out [Miyconst](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8h2Sf-yyo1WXeEUr-OHgyg) on YouTube. This Xeon/X99 setup is pretty popular in Russia and Brazil because of hardware prices and availability so this is a ~~Russian~~ Ukrainian guy who reviews all of these Chinese motherboards in great detail.The CPU cooler will be easy to find for about that price. Even new the Hyper 212 is only $35 but if you buy used just make sure you get the LGA2011-3 hardware necessary for securing it to the motherboard. $40 for 16GB of DDR4 is a good deal but I've seen this same deal pop up a few times but more often at $50. Finding used but working 500-1000GB HDD's for $10-20 is quite easy but I recommend only using this as a storage for games and re-downloadable files. I planned on having a m.2 SSD in this rig but accidentally bought a SATA m.2 drive instead of NVMe (SATA m.2 not supported by this motherboard) so I will still need to upgrade that. But any SSD for your OS and important files will do and you can find these for around $30-40 for a 256 GB SSD new maybe $10-20 more for an NVMe.The GPU of course is where the real bargain hunt will be. In 2021 GPU's are super overpriced but I had seen another 960 4GB for $40 in my area after purchasing 2 of them for $75 total so getting one around $40-60 is definitely possible. This is where I'd upgrade first (after an SSD). Other higher performing options would be the R9 390 8GB (recently purchased one for $80 and another for $100) the RX 580 8GB (recently purchased one for $125 but seen them locally for $150) or even a 1080 (purchased one for $200 but have seen them go for $260 locally). Really any decent GPU you can find for around $50-200 would be great with this build. I recommend referring to this [Tom's Hardware List](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy4388.html) to see where GPU's rank overall when you're shopping for a used GPU. This part will be where you'll spend most of your time hunting but those elusive GPU deals are out there!This case was a good find but I had also received a FREE CoolerMaster ATX case not too long ago with 3 140mm fans included in great condition. People often give away or sell their cases for cheap because they take up a lot of space. Look for one with fans included and even better if it comes with screws/standoffs.Finding a 500-700W PSU for $20-40 is not difficult but this is a component that many people would just prefer to buy new and I don't blame them. At least by 80+ Bronze if you go used. But honestly I think I'd rather buy a used PSU from a reputable brand than a cheap new PSU from some brand I never heard of.Overall this was a fun build to make and I love reducing e-waste so buying used is good for me. I highly recommend though that you have all the appropriate screws/hardware when buying used parts so ask about that stuff when you purchase something and if it's not included buy that replacement hardware online before you start your build because it's frustrating to start putting your PC together and then realize you don't have enough screws etc. It's a little more of a hassle but you can save a lot of money!Feel free to ask any questions this is only my second PC build (just started last month but have been diving DEEP into PC building rabbit holes online). But I hate when people on this sub instantly shoot people down asking about $200-400 PC's saying it's not possible. IT IS POSSIBLE but you have to get creative and it also helps to live in certain areas I won't deny that."
"So I hopped on this sub posting an outdated build and I got laughed on by many of you which is okay.I wanted to build the best PC to edit videos on in the $700-$800 range keeping it as small factor as possible. After a lot of discussion with many of you I settled for a mini itx build with a Silverstone SG13 case and an Asus Prime A320 chipset. A redditor who saw my post and was kind enough hit me up and explained that an A320 chipset is worthless with a Ryzen 5 2600 because it might not be compatible out of the box and I wont be able to overclock the CPU. It also does not have internal wify and so on.At first he offered that he sends me a 140mm fan because he has many lying around which I happily accepted and the next week he shipped it and casually mentioned that he included an Asrock Fatality AB350 mini itx motherboard. Not only has this saved me money but also time. A lot of it. NGL I was a bit sceptical that he's trolling or whatnot because you know it's Reddit but what do you know the mobo arrived and there it was with a [kind note](https://imgur.com/a/S9qSX1i). It was open sure but it looked legit and I couldn't believe that he actually did it until I plugged all the parts and [booted](https://imgur.com/ofi5xsc) it up and it worked fine.The $200 that he saved me allowed me to invest in a low-profile fan better GPU and better RAM (was gonna go for the 8gb) and a few other accessories such as VGA to HDMI adaptor and instead of finishing the build by early July I finished it just yesterday. That'show much that kind gesture helped.Without the PSU [https://imgur.com/LIt43QX](https://imgur.com/LIt43QX)With the PSU [https://imgur.com/nz007wO](https://imgur.com/nz007wO)So this is the final build with the expenses&#x200B;|Model|Price||:-|:-||[**AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 GHz 6-Core Processor**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jLF48d/amd-ryzen-5-2600-34ghz-6-core-processor-yd2600bbafbox)|$129||[**A**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JcVG3C/asus-prime-a320i-kcsm-mini-itx-am4-motherboard-prime-a320i-kcsm)**srock Fatality AB350- MINI ITX**|$200||[**Crucial 16 GB (1 x 16 GB) DDR4-3000mhz Memory**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jGvbt6/crucial-16-gb-1-x-16-gb-ddr4-2400-memory-ct16g4dfd824a)|$98||[**Western Digital Blue 500 GB 2.5" Solid State Drive**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/LRkj4D/western-digital-blue-500gb-25-solid-state-drive-wds500g2b0a)[**Toshiba 500 GB 2.5" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/y2HRsY/toshiba-500-gb-25-5400rpm-internal-hard-drive-mq01abf050m) **(previously owned)**|$74||**Samsung MZ-NLN2560 240gb (secondhand)**|$40||**GTX 1650S Pegasus 4GB DDR6**|$200||[**Silverstone SG13 Mini ITX Tower Case**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/dM8H99/silverstone-case-sstsg13b)|$54||[**Noctua NH-L9i 33.84 CFM CPU Cooler**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/xxphP6/noctua-nh-l9i-3384-cfm-cpu-cooler-nh-l9i)|$82||[**Silverstone Strider Essential 650 W 80+ Certified ATX Power**](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/j8g323/silverstone-power-supply-st60fes)|$50||HDMI TO VGA adapter|$26||Total|$954||How much I spent|± $690|After installing Windows and playing a few games I WAS LITERALLY BLOWN THE F\*\*\* AWAY AT HOW GOOD THIS THING IS. Going from my y-year old laptop to this one BEAST of a unit is one of the best experiences in my life. This is gonna sound silly but playing Battlefield 3 and CSGO in 60fps was a dream I would never have actualised in the past but now they run at 120fps minimum with ULTRA settings! These are the [temperatures](https://imgur.com/YU4ZJOb) when it is running Battlefield 3.I know the game is not much and the temperatures are not the best but I was told that 80C°for Ryzen processor is just another day at work and. When idle the temperatures are much better around 70C°.Now I am installing Adobe Premiere Pro and I have a haunch it is going to crash in the middle of work like my old laptop did . Trauma I am sure I wont be able to break away from soon (jk). Like Im literally still trying to comprehend that I own this PC.Thank you all for the help . This has been one hellova ride I will never forget.====================Edit: even when celebrating this build you guys keep giving me valuable advice. Thanks again. I'm swapping the noctua low profile CPU fan with an Arctic Liquid Freezer 120mm thus removing the front 140mm fan. I can't afford an XFX PSU unfortunately. I'm using a 3000mhz 16gb ram at the moment because I'm not gonna put the pc through anything serious just catching up on outdated games think ASC unity battlefield 1 and 5...etc and 1080p adobe premiere and after effects editing. Later when I start editing in 4k I'll get another 16gb 3000mhz with an SSD 1TB and unleash the full potential of the build. But for the time being it's more than enoughEdit 2: following your advice I got the Arctic Liquid freezer 2 120mm and installed it yesterday forcibly sohttps://i.imgur.com/WWgo7g9.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/F5PTRdj.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/DHzbwP8.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/oBBM0wZ.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/soybl9c.jpgThe ATX PSU is too big to fit the aio cooler inside so I had to bend the tubes and force the ATX in and surprisingly it worked. I had a lot of problems fitting the liquid cooler into the mobo because they weren't compatible and ended up improvising and had to install it like this https://imgur.com/a/2qhrVjZI dropped the backplate altogether and opted for a simple solution. But needless to say the temps went down significantly. This is the temperature while exporting a video!!! With the noctua it was at 90 C°. https://i.imgur.com/aHzfqxi.jpgAnd with that I can say that this build is officially ready! For now :D"
"I’ve wanted to build a pc since I was 15 (I’m 24 now) and I’ve been in a cycle of homelessness and never having enough money. I’ve finally got a place with enough room for a setup and after saving the past few months and researching the latest parts I’ve ordered my first ever gaming pc to be built by myself. I could not be more excited this feels like a childhood dream come true. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice along the way and reviewed my build. Everything should be coming Thursday I could not be more excited. Pc master race here I come!!!EDIT https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/8YqmqpEDIT 2wow wasn’t expecting such a response.

"Preface to the story:My brother and I are very close. We didn’t have a lot growing up. Growing up with only one parent who had their own issues meant I kinda looked after him. Birthdays were never a big deal in our families. A cake $20 and that was about it. So this year I decided I was going to get my brother the computer he’d always wanted. Video games were always a way to escape for us and how we’d bonded. Now that we’re older and can afford things I’ve switched over to pc gaming. My brother would come visit and play on mine. I always told him he should get one but he always said he couldn’t afford it (even though if he saved for a bit he could).I posted a GoFundMe on fb (hiding it from him) asking if anyone would want to donate to his birthday. Not surprisingly (as my brother is well loved) we got lots of donations for his build. I didn’t hit the full goal but it was enough to get him a good system.After being a long term lurker on this page and watching just about every YouTube video known to man on building instead of buying pre-made I decided to build it myself using the donations to buy the parts. The build:Ryzen R5 2600 CPUMSI B450 Gaming Plus motherboard16 GB Corsair DDR4 2400 RAMNVIDIA GTX 1070 GPUEVGA 550 B3 power supplyCorsair Carbide 275 caseAcer - S271HL 27" monitorWe also got him an Xbox One controller and a Corsair HS60 headset. Oh and a generic keyboard and my old Razer Naga.Needless to say he was a little shocked. I wrapped little gag gifts and dvds in the empty boxes the components came in. He made a comment about how I must have been upgrading my system recently. Then he got to his card and opened it. I listed everyone who had donated and how much we all loved him. I then told him to go look behind the couch to see what he got. I set it up for him and after he created his steam account I shared my library with him. I also bought him a month of Origin Premier. Thank you r/buildapc. With all of the knowledge on here I was able to give my brother a gift he’ll remember forever. Thank you for giving me confidence to do my first build. Also thank you for reading this long-winded story.[pics of the build! ](https://imgur.com/a/ijC5OD1)EDIT - Thank you so much for all of the kind words!! I really wish now I’d known about the Ryzen needing faster RAM but now I know for the future.PS - Also I had a few people message me and ask if they could donate or give Steam gift cards. I told my brother this and he said we should give to Extra Life instead. Extra Life (in case you didn’t know) is a charity organization for gamers whose funds go to the Children’s Miracle Network. Over the last ten years I’ve raised over $26000 for the Children’s Hospital of Richmond through them. My brother was born with a cleft palate and the Children’s Hospital there took care of him until he was 18. Once a month we’d drive there (about 3 hours away) for his therapy and assorted surgeries.

"I've been reading this sub for at least 3 months now. I repeatedly saw people saying to get parts at your local "Micro Center" I couldn't figure out for the life of me why people kept calling best buy a micro center since in my mind it was the only place to physically go to to find computer parts. Well today I decided to google micro center and I now know it is actually a computer parts store. The closes one is 30min from me in the city which is why I've never seen it... But now I know it exists and am upset I didn't drive down there to take a look. Just thought I would share in hopes someone would find my stupidity funny.Edit:  I can't believe this blew up so much. Thanks for all the love and awards! I have had so much fun commenting back to you guys these past few days. I've gotten so excited that I've convinced my fiance to take me there for my birthday on Monday so I can get some goodies for the new build. Yay!Edit 2: I'm here guys! I made it! Even my fiance loves it. She is convincing me to get a new case."
"I finally built myself a new PC. A long time coming as my previous rig was from circa 2014. My new build went flawlessly. R5 3600 32 gigs 3200mhz ram 1 TB m.2 drive.I reused my old graphics card from my old build (cause GPU prices are CRAZY) an R9 280. I'll upgrade the GPU at some point but its an OK placeholder.While I was taking out the graphics card on my old PC I noticed how dusty everything was. After extracting the GPU I pulled out the air compressor and gave everything a quick dust off.All was good with my new build installed linux mint and windows 10 in dual boot. Since my previous processor had integrated graphics I had planned on using it in my garage connected to a cheap TV for playing videos.I booted up my old PC to grab some files off of it and transfer them to my Pi server and... and fans were not spinning. After some basic trouble shooting it seems I toasted the motherboard while cleaning out the case. By blowing air into the case and making the fans spin I must have shorted it. Power supply still works optical drive SSD drive all work. But alas the heart of the computer is no more.TLDR/Lesson learned:If you are going to clean a computer with an air compressor;1. hold the fans in place to prevent them from spinning too fast.2. Unplug the fans from the motherboard.3. Let the dust settle because a dusty PC is better than no PC at all.Edit: some clarification. I was using an air compressor not canned air. I bet in some alternate timeline I used canned air and the computer still runs. The compressor is most certainly overkill but I've used it before to clean out my computer's and laptops with no consequences.I'm also speculating as to the cause of death. Some of you said it could be the moisture from the compressor. I live in a pretty dry area (~10% humidity) and always bleed out my compressor after every use. Still can't be sure on anything other than computer worked and now it doesn't. Maybe the computer knew it was being replaced 😂"
"Finished my build last night and to my dismay it won’t turn on. I get nothing when it’s plugged in and i hit the power button. Im not sure if my front panel is just wired improperly or if it’s my power supply. Absolutely nothing happens when i press the button.

This did give me the opportunity to do a deep half hour long cleaning and dusting of my PC but it also led to me realizing that I desperately need a new case as this thing is quite possibly the most un-intuitive piece of garbage I have ever had to deal with. (compared to the other PC I built my brother's.) My dad did find another dead spider underneath the PC after I moved it but it was brown so I assume it was the one my cat killed.so yeah sorry that there wasn't a huge infestation or anything at least the PC is hyper-clean now and I even took some time to fix a cable management issue.edit: there's a tiny hole in the corner of the wall near there as well. I doubt they could fit through it but who knows that's probably where they're coming from. Why they chose my room and to all climb up the same wall in the same direction is a complete mystery to me."
"I've recently been learning about how different rgb types work and I thought I had it all figured out. 4 pin is non addressable rgb and 3 pin is addressable. 4 pin being 12v and 3 pin being 5v.Using my newfound rgb knowledge I told my friend that it would be fine to plug in his 4 pin rgb strip that he got from Walmart years ago into the 4 pin rgb header on his motherboard. Once he got it set up he noted how extremely bright it seemed and how extremely hot it was to the touch.I told him it's probably fine after I read that some rgb strips can run pretty hot. He said it got to the point where it was literally too hot to touch and decided to unplug it. Upon inspecting the rgb strip it was clearly labeled "5v" on one of the connectors.So moral of the story - 4 Pin isn't always 12v and 3 Pin isn't always 5v. Although for the most part it seems to be. Hopefully I can save someone from making the same mistake unless everyone already knows this and I just look stupid for posting."
"Since an unusually large number of people might be building or upgrading tomorrow here are the most common pitfalls I see on building:* Plug your monitor cable [into the GPU not the motherboard](https://i.imgur.com/FCJButj.jpg)!* If you have a high-refresh monitor make sure to set your refresh rate. Right-click desktop -> Display settings -> Advanced display settings -> Refresh rate. (Nvidia and AMD software also have settings for this.)* Make sure to enable XMP in your BIOS to ensure your RAM is running at rated speed. You can check using tools like CPU-Z which will report current speed (in MHz so double it to get MTs which is advertised speed).* If building new [this](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) is the official Windows 10 Media Creation tool. ([Win 11 here](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)). Make sure that any software you install is from the creator and not websites like Softtonic or Cnet which may or may not come with "additional" software.* If you are going to install software use a reputable source. Eg Ninite.com is a great place to download and install freeware - Chrome VLC Discord 7zip etc. [Nvidia Tiny Update Checker](https://github.com/ElPumpo/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/releases) is the easiest way I've found to keep Nvidia up-to-date.* 2 sticks of RAM almost always [goes in slots 2 & 4](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ram) from the left. Check your motherboard manual! * remember that new PSUs almost always ship with the power switch in the 'off' position. Don't forget to flip the PSU to the 'on' position (if you're building on some eggnog after I did last Christmas). ([thanks /u /zaconil](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/zufg7e/to_anyone_getting_who_might_be_upgrading_hardware/j1jeg6l/)!)* Don't forget put the I/O shield on before you install the motherboard!Happy Holidays all."
"Hello everybody!I play a lot of video games and like to keep up to date with computers and tech and both IRL and amongst my friends online I have something of a reputation for being "that tech guy".As a result of this I often find myself recommending computer builds or parts to people or having to explain what certain computer-related terms mean or how they might be useful and/or relevant.I have been doing this enough lately that I sort of realized that lots of people might benefit from a good well-written guide on computer parts and terminology.Yes it is true that there are places where people can ask questions about computers already however I think that having a good singular reference point that can be easily pointed to for those that want to learn on their own or who have trouble asking for help from others will be very useful as well as allowing much more depth in the answers than could otherwise be reasonably given.So I wrote just such a guide.Several actually - As there are numerous different audiences for a "PC Guide" I have written several documents that I hope will be broad enough in accessibility and scope to provide useful information for everybody regardless of their prior computing knowledge:* Technical Details: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p482g3YPWjZZ-SEq\_SLe\_BakGn6SEzxW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p482g3YPWjZZ-SEq_SLe_BakGn6SEzxW/view?usp=sharing)  Current Version: 1.7  A very long and in-depth guide that covers \[almost all\] of the terms that are used for computer components that a PC user would come across or want to know about.* Component Specifications: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDWARbOXCx6VRiratPyT4hO6LommWAiu/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDWARbOXCx6VRiratPyT4hO6LommWAiu/view?usp=sharing)  A much *much* shorter and more basic version of the above that covers the most crucial and important terms only.* Component Compatibility Quick Reference: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeTua1h5swOZzlJs2qrlePqwx89RNLaV/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PeTua1h5swOZzlJs2qrlePqwx89RNLaV/view?usp=sharing)  A quick bullet-point list of some important compatibility points that users could check before buying either a PC or components for a PC.* Industry Overview: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ey48nv4CKgK3cheR-2XUwpz3CP9xR6rE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ey48nv4CKgK3cheR-2XUwpz3CP9xR6rE/view?usp=sharing)  A quick overview of some of the most major things in the PC space that affected consumers in 2018 and early 2019.I hope they help somebody.&#x200B;If anybody has any comments or errors to point out then you can leave a comment message me here on reddit where I am of course u/Ad3506 or at [Ad3506@gmail.com](mailto:Ad3506@gmail.com).Please make sure that any error you wish to point out is actually in the most recent version of the document though.Thank you to everybody who has suggested suggestions or pointed out typos or grammatical errors!&#x200B;Edits: I have now started adding version numbers on the first \[title\] page of the technical details.  Newer versions will be clearer better explained have less types and have more info in them so I highly recommend using the most recent version."
"You may remember the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/qypt7b/are_1440p_monitors_really_that_big_much_of_an/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) a made a little over a week ago. I asked if 1440p was really worth it and 95% of the 600+ comments said yes. So I bought one. I got it today and set it up and man it is night and day. I ended up getting the Acer Predator XB3.To anyone wondering if it's worth the upgrade 100% yes only if you are able to handle it. I don't think it's worth upgrading an entire computer for. And its definitely not worth feeling bad about not having. I could still go back to 1080 and be content.Thank you all. I wouldn't have done it without your all's recommendations."

"So once upon a time a friend of mine to whom I sold my old RX590 for 100$ in these trying times.. repaid the favour by telling me about the situation in the crypto-mining space.. People are legitimately trading better newer cards for 5700XTs since the 5700XT mines faster and more efficiently.. I was skeptic at first but I hit one of the people up and he immediately told me the whole story about why he wants to trade and why's my card better for mining and stuff.. So we made a deal I went across half of Czechia and my dude pulls up with a car opens the trunk and it's goddamn full of 6700XTs and 3060Tis.. Like at least 20 boxes.. And he just goes "Well pick which one you want" so I grabbed a Sapphire Pulse 6700XT and handed him my 5700XT he gave me the purchase contract with 2 years of warranty left and I went home with my free upgrade.. Which works like a charm btw.tl;dr: check online marketplaces in your areas if you have a 5700XT they're wanted hard right now and can be traded for better cards with no add. payments.Edit: [An article about GPU hashrates I was told to post here for y'all by my miner friend.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/best-picks/best-mining-gpus-benchmarked-and-ranked)"

"Everytime someone asks about buying a video card on here I see them instantly flooded with responses shaming them for even considering doing such an atrocious thing. It's literally all I see on this sub "Don't buy a GPU the 3000 series are right around the corner." Ok well sOME OF US ARE BUILDING OUR FIRST PC AND DON'T HAVE A GPU?  Think about that before you blindly post you're telling someone to wait an unknown amount of time and forgo having a working computer just for a potentially better deal?See how ridiculous that sounds...&#x200B;EDIT: I'm glad that a lot of you agree with me it's good to see supportive people in this community :)&#x200B;EDIT 2: I'm looking for a gpu that will support 120+ fps at 1080p max settings while streaming 1080p 60 fps (top fps titles like COD Valorant Rainbow Six)&#x200B;EDIT 3: Silver? :o Thats my first reddit award EVER!!!

"After a second round of my pump going out...both were coolermaster ML240. First was under warranty second was just barely out.I thought a simpler solution would be the old school heat-sink and fan set up (cheaper too)..like us old nerds used to use back in the stone ages of the 2010s.I picked up a Noctua NH-U12S and its performance is better than the AIO ever was and superficially quieter because I got rid of the radiator and fans from the top of the case.Unless you are doing some serious overclocking I don't think most normal users need AIO at all for daily driving.I know your Krakens are pretty fly looking but from here on out I'm rocking tan and brown."

"Photos here: [https://imgur.com/a/67P8dz5](https://imgur.com/a/67P8dz5)  First build in \~20 years...I decided to get the best gaming PC little money can buy for Christmas for my 11yo son -- and in all honesty for myself too :)He was playing the likes of Minecraft Roblox and various Flash games online on an old laptop.The guideline for the build was: budget **£400** best bang for the buck cut corners where possible.I got to have fun researching and building.  The kid got a gaming computer an understanding of what's inside the black box and hands-on experience.  We both had a great time together!**TL;DR:**AMD Radeon **RX 580** (SH): £125  Intel Core i3 **10100F**: £76  Gigabyte mobo: £58  Seasonic S12 III **550W**: £50  **256GB** SSD + **2TB** HDD: £0 (see below)  Crucial **2x8GB** 2666 MHz: £40  CiT Flash case + extras: £40  Mechanical keyboard: £22**\*** **Grand total: £411.** Close enough!Do you think there's anything obviously wrong?The long story piece by piece.**Case: CiT Flash:** **£35**Could have saved £5 on something even cheaper but it's a *really* small price to pay for side *and* front tempered glass panels and 4 *oh so bling* fans! The kid loved it.The metallic walls are super thin as expected. It's fine just don't use it to hammer nails.For the price it turned out to be great: adequate hidden space behind the right panel for "cable management" (euphemism for the jumble of cables but hey they're out of sight) 4 very RGB fans (but not addressable they just connect to a SATA power cable and there's a button to change modes)Unexpectedly even the wife ~~loved~~ liked it!The 3 front intake fans were place *very* close to the front panel but were easy to move further back inside the case for more adequate air flow. One exhaust fan in the back. Positive pressure FTW!It even has metallic mesh dust filters on top (magnetic) and bottom (not).The one thing it does not have is a dust filter where it actually matters - the front panel which brings me to...**Ghetto dust filters: £5**I ordered a pack of *dryer sheets* and a strip of magnetic tape to hold them in place and covered the front fans. Sorted and I tell myself it doesn't look too bad!**CPU & Mobo: Intel 10100F: £76 Gigabyte H410M S2H: £58**I was sure it will be an AMD system (Ryzen 3100) for the longest time but was swayed to the blue side by lack of availability or price hikes. The cheapest Intel motherboards were also a bit cheaper than the cheapest AMD counterparts.It had to be a gen 10 Intel to have *some* chance of upgradability later without replacing the motherboard too.The motherboard was the winner of the race to the bottom. No frills. 2 RAM slots (but hey no way to install the RAM in the wrong slots!).I assume it will support the current line-up of gen10 CPUs *and* future gen11's.In a couple years it will be time to look at the SH market for CPUs. \[EDIT: It appears I was wrong. Bummer.\]Also "BONUS"! - cheaper memory since this combo only supports RAM < 2666 MHz. Thanks Intel! \\s**RAM: Crucial 2x8 GB 2666 MHz: £40**Again cheapest one that fit the bill. Black friday-ish price drop. No XMP. Oh well Intel won't let me use faster RAM anyway.**PSU: Seasonic S12 III 550W 80+ Bronze: £50**Could have gotten something cheaper but remembered the advice of our forebears:*don't skimp on the PSU don't meet the fire brigade*.Seasonics are widely regarded as some of the more trustworthy PSUs and this had enough power for the GPUs that would fit the budget.Of course it's not modular. Why pay extra for modular when I can spend 5 minutes of my life to secure the unused cables to the case?At some point I could have bought the 650W version for the same price but I had already bought this one and had opened the package.**Storage: Micron 256GB SSD + Seagate Desktop SSHD 2TB SSHD £0!!**Gutted an old laptop for the SSD.Remembered I had a box of PC parts laying around unused for years. There were a bunch of hard drives one of which I was thrilled to discover had a quite decent 2TB capacity and it's a *SSHD*! (is that even still a thing?)**GPU: Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 580 Pulse 4GB: £125 + blood sweat and tears**I didn't expect it to run an eye-candy game like Forza Horizon 4 at 3440x1440 everything maxed out at \~55 FPS. I'm impressed. So far of all Xbox Game Pass games we tried the only one that gets choppy is MS Flight Simulator.*The GPU saga*I started looking at GPUs in November. Was considering a GTX 1650 Super (new) or a GTX 980 Ti (SH) each going for about £140 and wondering if that's a good enough deal.Then December 1st came and the global GPU drama kicked in!"You thought *£140* was too much for a GTX 980 Ti? How does *£210* sound? HA!"For weeks I couldn't find *anything* half-decent within the budget. I saw "recently sold" cards at decent prices but they were getting sold *so fast* I didn't stand a chance. Xmas was getting closer and I was getting desperate.So I wrote a bot.It scours eBay and messages me when cheaper cards show up. The 'buying' part is manual.There are *definitely* other people out there that have automated the process because the time to react for a deal seems to be 1-3 MINUTES!That's how I could get my hands on the RX 580 for an acceptable £125! Xmas was saved!**Peripherals****Dell ultra-wide monitor 3440x1440 60 Hz:** **£0**I happened to have one around.**Keyboard: Aula Assault RGB mechanical £22**This one was firmly in "splurge" territory but the kid *was chuffed* with the crazy lighting patterns and the (way too) clicky blue (probably knock-off - but still) switches.At the end of the day £22 for a new mechanical keyboard (that turns out to be built like a tank) is not a bad price."
"Or does it?Since a week ago my dad is high on the idea of mining. He is planning to spend money (we cant really spend)  on a rig and I am losing arguements. I need precise short easy to understand facts to convince him that getting Into mining is a bad idea. Or am I wrong? His idea is to set up and forget about it let it sit and generate income ($500 a month he says). I am aware this is a little off topic but I am afraid of I go over to mining subs they won't really argue for my side.Edit: afaik he had planned to get himself 6 mid range GPUs. Not sure which exactly 1060 (?). I am aware of the fact that peak of mining is gone. But he is a stubborn person and I won't convince him with an idea that barrier to entry is hard. That won't cut.Edit: well that went well. I actually have collected myself and no longer seeing all this as a waste of time and money. I will have a conversation with him Tomorrow exploring our options and future.Thank you all for explaining it in from both perspectives. I appreciate it.EDIT: I am sorry. I thought my last edit would close the discussion. My bad. We spoke and he decided to calm down hand think more thoroughly this through. He's gonna look at the numbers and make his own decision.Again thank you all for input. "
"I have never used m.2 before today and decided to buy a m.2 wifi/bluetooth card. The premise of super-fast wifi and bluetooth sounded great to me and this m.2 all in one was cheaper than any of the pcie options. The package I received had no information on it at all - just the chip. I find the socket on my mobo when I get home and check youtube as to how to install it. 'Looks simple enough to me' I thought. It did seem a little strange that there was another etch in my wifi card than there was in the video and the card would be facing upside down... but I put it down to the wifi card needing fewer lanes or something. The card fit  afterall.After booting up the computer the wifi wasnt working. I searched the Intel website for a driver but there werent any to be installed.'I mustn't have inserted it fully.' was going though my mind as I reopened the case.I go to adjust the card and what could only be described as a glimpse into Hades of a sensation occurred. This thing was HOT. Like sausage sizzling hot.I've never had a dead-on-arrival before but that was what I convinced myself as to what had happened... what an imbecile.After some research I start hearing  'e-type' and 'm-type' being thrown about in some more relevant youtube videos. Whoops.It seems crazy to me that this wasnt even documented on the specifications on the websie from which I bought  it. Just the board form factor of 22x30. If it wasnt for these youtube videos I'd be embarrassing myself by claiming they gave me a dud product.The chip is likely dead and the socket possibly so too. I think I shall be sticking to SATA and PCIE from now on.Tl:drNever installed m.2 before. Installed the e-type form factor upside down in m-type socket and got burnt."

"So just 3 months ago I gave my dad the idea of selling my gaming laptop and perhaps building myself a computer to which he quickly rejected and after a good week of talking he said yes but that he wanted to pay for it and not sell the laptop because I may need it for college. I built my first PC finding local deals: Offerup Facebook marketplace craigslist and built a $700 PC in under $500 (Ryzen 5 3600 1650 Super 32GB RAM blah blah). My dad told me to sell it to potentially make some money and i did and built another one sold it and yet another one and now i’m around in my area with plenty of people paying me to help them build their PC’s which has honestly been the most fun thing i’ve done in my life. I’m so grateful for what my dad blessed me with and all the things he’s done for me. PC building has honestly just changed my life it’s made me feel like i’m actually doing something with my life.EDIT: Wow! Thank you guys for the supportive messages and all the advice you guys have given me. I couldn’t be more thankful for you guys. Ive been reading as many comments as I can answering any questions. Feel free to DM me guys. Thank you so much for the awards too!!"
"Back in November I decided to upgrade my case after three years. I went from the CORSAIR Carbide Spec-04 to the Meshify C. This meant that the case looked a million times sexier and it had a large tempered glass window to show off my internals. The case was $130. I decided *why the hell not*. I bought a vertical mounting bracket so I can show off my GTX 970. That costed $50 and I cut through the new case.Then my GPU wasn't looking too nice with the case. Since it was underperforming anyways I decided to upgrade to an EVGA GTX 1070. A $300 upgrade.Then I decided to fill in the two empty RAM slots for aesthetics. I run virtual machines and the Adobe Suite anyways so I guess it was justified. Another $80.     But hey. My CPU and case fans were all different colors and weren't consistent. So I bought a set of 3 case fans (white to match the case). $30 again. This upgrade spree ended recently because now I'm broke. In addition to the things I bought above I also got a new white alarm clock a white Xbox One S controller white PSU extensions RGB LEDs and a white Glorious Model D mouse to fit the theme that I'm running. Oh yeah and I got a new chair too.TLDR: What started as a $130 upgrade turned into a ~$1000 upgrade spree. I have no regrets."
"Ever since I bought my PC my cat seems to love sleeping on top of the PC.  This has been a huge issue since my cat blocks both exhaust fans on the top and the CPU at idle has reached 70-80 degrees.My cat is a stubborn guy and he won't stop sleeping on top of my PC no matter what.

So now that I am retired we still have two machines running 22.04 Ubuntu.  In addition to the photo sorting I have a book due to my publisher and nature camera projects for bird houses to create using some creative Raspberrry Pi tinkering a personal web page and much more.

"There are many silly names and conventions in CS but nothing grinds my gears like the stupid fucking RAID naming scheme. First of all the names are utterly undescriptive. Like what exactly is RAID 4 for example? Well the only piece of information you can pull out of that name is that it you're working with 2+ disks because you know RAID. That's it. Beyond that you can't even begin to guess what it might be unless you already have an idea. It's just a stupid number that tells you nothing useful whatsoever. It doesn't even imply anything.Second who the hell thought using the word "level" to refer to different RAID configs was a good idea? That word followed by numbers comes with the inevitable implication that the RAIDs follow a natural progression of sorts which is absolutely not true at all. Is RAID 1 a logical step up from RAID 0? No it's not. They're completely different stuff with completely different performance goals. There is no reasonable line of progression where you go "one level above" RAID 0 and land at RAID 1. The relation does kinda exist for certain levels like 4 and 5 for example I'll give it that.And then there's the RAID xy configurations that not only require you to have prior knowledge as to what RAID x and RAID y are but also they don't give much useful information about how it really works. Take RAID 10 and RAID 01. Which one is mirrored then striped and which one is striped then mirrored? I know the answer. Though not because the name tells it to me but because I had to look it up many times in the past and now I have it memorized.If you want to make your names look kewl and 1337 just call it RAID-S for "striped" instead of RAID 0 for example. RAID-DP for "distributed parity" instead of the shitty RAID 5 that means fuck all. Not perfect of course but at least then the name actually has *some* descriptive power. WHY NUMBERS MAN?TL;DR: Using an ascending numerical order to name shit when there's no natural logical order was a stupid fucking idea and whoever came up with it should be very ashamed of themselves. Can't come up with decent names so uses shitty numbers instead smh.I'm angry.edit: for more anger check out how [ibanez name their guitars](https://ibanez.fandom.com/wiki/Ibanez_model_numbers). After 11 years of owning my Ibanez I still have to take a moment to remember how it's called. Shit can get *wild*."

"Earlier this week I was elated to find out that I had *finally* won a 3080 from the Newegg shuffle after entering since November without any success. My Ventus 3080 Ti arrived just 2 days later on Wednesday and I was packed with excitement eager to get my new card in. Because my power supply was only 750w I felt it was probably best to upgrade to 850w Seasonic Platinum before putting the new card in (my 9900k is heavily OC’d). After finishing work I sat down at my desk and couldn’t wait to get my build running with the new hardware. I took out my old Thermaltake PSU and here’s where everything went horribly wrong. “I’m sure there’s no problem just using the old cables that are connected to everything” I thought. No. **No.** **HUGE MISTAKE**.When my PC didn’t post or show any power after swapping the cables into my new PSU (yes they fit fine) I was puzzled. I thought it could be the cables (duh) and swapped the ATX power and CPU power cables as well as my 3080 Ti PCI-E power connector. I did *not* swap the remaining cables for SATA power and AIO / fan connectors.I think you guys see where this is going. After putting everything back in I flipped the power and was relieved to see my mobo light up. Hit the power switch and the power instantly cycled. Everything flashed for half a second and turned off. My stomach dropped harder than you could imagine and I was instantly overcome with dread. I tried again. Same result. Knew something was obviously very wrong and my mind immediately went to the modular cables. I knew what I did. It was too late. My total damages were - 3x NZXT AER 140mm RGB fans - 1x NZXT AER 120mm RGB fan - 1x Corsair H115i Platinum AIO (no longer works I think the pump got fried)- 2x WD HDDs somewhere around 4TB. Thankfully no valuable data just a bunch of junk stuff I’ve amassed over the last 2 or 3 PCs I had them in. All the fans still work as fans but the LEDs are completely dead. AIO just doesn’t work at all.My one very VERY bright reprieve in this shitty experience is that the PC didn’t power on when I first had the wrong cables attached to my motherboard and 3080. Thank GOD none of my expensive parts were damaged (mobo CPU GPU ram are all fine). I was able to run over to Bestbuy just before they closed on Wednesday night to pick up a replacement AIO but had to downgrade to a 240mm because that’s all that was in-store. Fortunately after installing the new AIO everything was working fine and I got to enjoy my new card for the rest of the night.I share my story of extreme stupidity with you guys in the hopes that no one who reads it will repeat my mistake. I’ve been building PCs for like 15 years over a dozen builds under my belt but I never swapped out a PSU before. Never read this anywhere so it just didn’t occur to me that the cables are *not* universal and standardized. After reading some heavy-hearted threads by other builders who made the same mistake I learned that this is a lot more common knowledge than I thought.Here’s your friendly reminder for this year guys: **don’t be lazy swap all of your modular PSU cables if you change power supplies!!**"
"Title. After using/gaming on my 144hz Viewsonic Xg2401 for a few months It's painful to use a 60hz Asus or Dell monitor. 144hz is so much smoother not only in games when pushing 144 fps but also just for general use. Watching videos web browsing. It feels and looks so much smoother. Don't make the jump unless you're prepared to never go back. That's my opinion."
"While I was just a lurker here and sometimes read about pc problems which I didnt expect that it would be too useful to me. My PC has just experienced the same thing as someone who has a rat peed on their GPU in my case I wasn't using that PC for a week and when I came to use it won't boot up opening the PC I saw that there are small bits of paper inside it and the GPU is wet which is half dry including the pins which has some green thing on them. Then I remember all the advice you all made about others who experienced the same which I immediately cleaned it throughly then waited about a day to use it and it worked that is why I am grateful to all of you who helped others and making someone like me avoid mistakes early on.Honestly I don't want to break my PC because it was the money I saved up using my launch money on 2019 and completed all the parts early 2020 I don't have parts to spare and the GPU I bought in was RX 580 the fastest GPU I can afford with my launch money which I saved up for a few months losing it now plus lockdown means that I cant buy a part after covid subsided or until I found a job as a student.So for me I am truly grateful for all of you without your advice here It would probably be too late before I found a solution to it."
"I have a PC I built in 2015 with near top of the line consumer components for the time. The motherboard is the MSI Z97-GD65 Gaming and it has a TPM header so I technically could just plug in a TPM module and install Windows 11. The issue is I didn't buy it at the time..no build guide ever suggested buyers they would need one (to be honest at the time I don't think I even knew that it was a thing) and later on PCs started to come with TPM built right in the CPU or the motherboard so you didn't really need to bother. But..what about people like me? I can't find TPM modules on the market at all and even if I could I doubt I could still find one compatible with a Z97 board. I suspect thousands of users who built a PC 4 or 5 years ago and haven't upgraded yet will have the same issue. Most people don't even know what TPM is and even if you do you might realize you are in my same situation and be unable to install it. So..am I out of options? With the current market I really can't afford to upgrade (because I would have to buy new RAM new CPU new cooler) and the TPM module which was supposed to be a cheap 20$ option for people who needed bitlocker or whatever is now basically unavailable on the market so no Windows 11 for me?**Edit:** further consideration about casual users. I checked my parent's PC a prebuilt from 2014..it's still completely usable thanks to the quad core and the 8GB of RAM. It doesn't have TPM enabled which might mean it's either disabled in the BIOS or it's missing from the mobo completely. When you use the Windows 11 compatibility checker the message says the PC isn't compatible and the "learn more" button links you to Microsoft website where the suggestion is "Buy a new PC" with a link to their own Microsoft store selling Surface PCs. If the webpage stays about the same until launch millions of users (because millions of people have PCs from before 2015 where TPM is disabled by default or missing completely) will see a notification that their PC "isn't good enough" and will be redirected to Microsoft's own store to buy a new product. This feels really scummy.**Edit 2:** [The current list of Intel supported CPUs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-intel-processors) ([here's the AMD list](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-amd-processors)) includes only Intel 8th gen or above. If this list is final (which we don't know yet) it might look like a **lot** of people will be left out.**Edit 3:** Some users have pointed out that TPM might be a quite controversial topic especially for those of you who care about DRM and the freedom to use your hardware however you like. Thanks to u/Marco-YES for doing a quick breakdown of the criticalities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/o7kzjo/windows_11_requires_tpm_12_are_people_with_older/h2zzqa6/). You can find further resources for reading about the topic in his comment. Basically a point of contention would be if we really need a TPM requirement at all and whether it's actually a bad thing for consumers.**Edit 4:** A lot of people with newer systems got the "incompatible" message when running the utility (which can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck)). To check if TPM is the issue press Start and type "tpm.msc" and it will tell you what version you have if it's there at all. You need at least version 1.2 according to current information. Additionally you can type "System information" and in the main tab of the window that opens up you can check whether Secure Boot is enabled. Both of these options **might be off by default** so you'll need to go into the UEFI/BIOS and turn them on. This will likely solve the incompatibility message for those with newer systems."
"Software such as [Intel Smart Response Technology (Intel)](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/architecture-and-technology/rapid-storage-technology.html) [AMD StoreMI (Ryzen)](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/store-mi) and [PrimoCache (Generic)](https://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/primo-cache/) let you turn a small SSD into a cache for your larger HDD that will automatically and seamlessly put your frequently accessed files onto the SSD while allowing you to access the full space of the HDD.I had a 240GB SATA SSD that used to be my boot drive back in 2013 sitting in my PC still with no real purpose alongside a few 2TB HDDs for games I don't play that much and backups/media. I used the AMD StoreMI to turn the 240GB SSD into a cache for the 2TB HDD and have been impressed with the results so far.Seems like it can basically replace the system of using a HDD as long term storage for games and then manually moving them to an SSD when you're playing them frequently. Instead it'll just automatically move those frequently accessed games to the SSD and you can just treat it like a normal drive.What do y'all think of this technology?credit to /u/coololly for pointing this out."
"Last year my business partner went out and purchased one of these: [Samsung CRG9](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Double-49-Inch-Monitor-LC49RG90SSNXZA/dp/B07L9HCJ2V).  Of course he could not help but invite me over to see the thing.  After I picked my jaw up off the floor I left envious but happy to see he was happy with his new purchase.&#x200B;Fast forward a few months and he calls me back over to his house.  I was certain he got a new toy and just wanted to brag again.  Low and behold there sat a shipping crate with my name on it.  He got me one.  What a guy.  Its a good thing I make him a lot of money lol.&#x200B;Anyway my first thought was excitement.  Then I realized that I did not have a computer that could properly drive the thing.  Here is what I have replaced:* CPU - Intel Core i7-6700k (Overclocked to 4.6ghz)* CPU Cooler - Noctua NH-D15* Motherboard - MSI Z170A Gaming M7* RAM - 16gb PC-3200 DDR4* GPU - Gigabyte GTX 1080 (non-ti)* Case - Fractal Design Define R5* PSU - Seasonic X-850* Boot Drive - Intel 660p 500GB NVME M.2* Data Drive - Samsung 850 Evo 1TB* Data Drive - Sabrent Rocket 2TB NVME M.2 (added last year)* Monitor - Acer Preditor XB1 (27" IPS 165hz)&#x200B;By all accounts this computer was near top of the line when I built it in 2016.  It ran most things at 1440p at least at 60 fps (and almost anything not current gen AAA at >100 fps).  But that was then.  This was now.  5120x1440 is TWICE the pixels as my old - admittedly awesome - monitor.  In order to take advantage of this very generous gift I was going to have to upgrade.  My wife also needed a new machine (at least new to her she is the receiver of technological hand-me-downs after all).  Given that I decided to start over from scratch.First and foremost I had to face the fact that top end computer components are hard to come by right now.  I had to camp websites discord chats youtube channels with running availability tickers the works.

I also pilfered the 2TB Sabrent M.2 drive out of the old computer so I have a pair of them in the new build giving me 4TB of storage.&#x200B;A couple of points for purchasing devisions:* CPU - originally I was hoping to get a 5900x or even a 5950x.  No not because I do a bunch of productivity that would demand it.  Simply because I wanted it.  Guess what unless I wanted to support a scalper that just was not going to happen.  Benchmarks on the 5800x put its gaming performance on par with 5900x.  It also has 8 cores which should keep it relevant for this entire console cycle as developers write software to take full advantage of multi-core gaming.  I originally bought the 5800x through Newegg but due to substantial issues with shipping and delivery I ended up re-ordering the processor through B&H.  Newegg still hasn't sent me my purchase nor issued me a refund.  B&H has been wonderful.* GPU - Yes I overpaid.  But not by much.  The retail on this card is $1099.  I got it for at 26% premium which is almost directly in-line with the new tariffs.  I am happy with it.  And this thing is amazing.  I chose AMD instead of going team-green this time purely because the only card that competes with the 6900XT is going for $2400 even at retail now (RTX 3090).  Frankly I don't see much visual difference with ray-tracing (I am visually impaired) but I do see huge difference in proper freesync and smooth frame rates.* RAM - 64gb is a lot.  And no I do not need it.  But now I can tell myself I could dual boot and run virtual machines and set up a RAM disk.  I won't likely ever do those things but I can tell myself I will.  And that feels pretty good.&#x200B;All in all I am very happy with the build.  I put it all together and it actually booted right up which feels nice.  My ISP is probably wondering why I have downloaded 2TB of data in the last 24 hours but I have gigabit internet for a reason.  Now it is off to play Cyberpunk 2077 at 5120x1440 and have it run smooth as butter."

Even though it does run noticeable smoother with the Ryzen 9 3900x it's still not where I want it to be once I start color grading 4K footage.

"Hi everyoneI've seen many people who say 8GB of RAM is enough for a gaming PC. My brother has 8GB and I got 16GB we run the same kind of games but is PC has hard time if he doesn't close his music and/or other software while playing (not all the games bc some are easy to run). I'm really happy I invested in 16GB of RAM.This is a discussion I know it depends on what you're doing with your computer RAM is expensive. I want to know what you guys think of it: 8GB VS 16GB "

"I had a Ryzen 3 1300x and it approached a point where I couldn’t run Warzone and Xbox chat/discrord at the same time it pushed my CPU too far. So I caved in and went with a Ryzen 5 3600 and let me tell you insane difference. What pushed my 1300x to 100% OC’ed (720p trying 60fps) pushes my Ryzen 5 MAYBE 30% without OC (1080p solid 60fps). I didn’t realize how CPU heavy modern games are becoming.Thank you to this community for making this rather new PC gamer VERY happy. That’s all I have :)P.S. A Ryzen 5 3600 / GTX 1660 Super 6gb combo is an absolute monster combination *chefs kiss*. It works flawlessly on my MSI B350M Gaming MOBO.Edit: HOLY CRAP did not expect this to blow up for any reason. Glad y’all enjoyed my mini review! Thanks everyone!!"
"Hello people smarter than meFirst off here is my entire build. [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YkhgzN](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YkhgzN) I am really bummed to be posting this. I am writing this post at work so I do not have any pictures but I can upload those  if need be tonight. I decided to build my first PC ever (I was super hesitant about this. This whole process was not as fun or rewarding as you all made it out to be lol) and I really just want to play the outer worlds. So I used Paul's Hardware LTT and Jayztwocents for videos and read all of the manuals for my parts. I assembled everything to what I thought correctly putting together the pc was fairly easy and simple. I fumbled a little with understanding the power switch and power reset cables and which pins I plug those tiny wires into. And the AMD stock fan was hard to install a little as well. I saved money aside to upgrade the cooling in this pc as well if I saw the temps running to high but I was told I could get away with what I have for now. However I digress... So nothing happened after I flipped the power switch. I can confirm I checked to make sure the PSU was plugged in! I do not want to take it in somewhere just yet. What are the first steps I can do to trouble shoot this issue? If you decide to respond thanks in advanced! &#x200B;TL:DR: What are the first steps I should take to troubleshoot if nothing happened after I flipped the power switch?"

"The past month or so I've been delving in to building my first custom PC since I bought one assembled in 2010. Before this time I had no idea how a PC actually worked.After removing my GPU from my older system I noticed something I have never noticed until now. The fans that come with the case have never been plugged in. My PC has been running with the CPU cooler as the only source of cooling for 9 years...I am a noob.Edit: And now everyone knows. Anyway here's some pics. [https://imgur.com/a/Rel4Pzr](https://imgur.com/a/Rel4Pzr)   Fun fact: The case I bought was actually named Vision Phantom Silent edition. Fitting name. My computer was born to be a meme."

"Hey guys and gals. I was here last week asking about my son's (pretty terrible) PC build prospect. So it turns out that he went to a website that he picked the wrong CPU and everything else on the available options were just outdated and overpriced. Needless to say he had no idea what he was doing and was helped by a friend that also had no idea. I broke it to him that he had to start over and try again. He was a little upset but ultimately he was glad that we didn't buy that machine. We got a lot of great advice here and we learned a ton and became even more overwhelmed. I told him to read that thread carefully watch some youtubers go back to the drawing board and think about what he wants to buy.  He laughed about some of your comments. I told him that most people here said he doesn't need to spend the $1500 that he wanted to spend and he should think about spending less. So we tried for $1000 but settled on $1200 for a PC and everything and he can save the $300 for whatever he wants I'll still give him double the money he saved. So get this he said "I'll have $300 left? I want to buy Eva (his little sister - 7) a nintendo switch!" and my heart sank what a great kid! To be only 10 and working so hard and saving and wanting to build something then want to do something for his little sis without skipping a beat I just love that guy. I must be dreaming. Well he came back with this build which puts him well over the $1200 and he said he doesn't know what else to cut. He explained the Ryzen 3600 is the CPU he wants this time. It seems like everything is low in inventory or increased in price. I know some people said that he should wait till this next CPU comes out but I'm coming back from deployment and he's really looking forward to building this with me when I get back.  I don't know if I can make him wait much longer it's got to be torture for a 10 year old. I'm so proud of him I'm thinking about just buying this one he picked out if you professionals say it's good and I'll buy him a switch to give his sister for her birthday next month. Since you helped so much that time if there's any other advice we'll take it.

"I'll be building a new PC soon since my current one is way outdated and I was wondering what programs I should install out the get-go? ie) CCleaner anti-virus etc."
"[https://imgur.com/a/UazRg27](https://imgur.com/a/UazRg27)So the place I work for needed two new computers to do some coding/machine learning. Having built two PC's this year and having developed a satisfaction in doing so I jumped at the opportunity to satiate my hunger.Right now our currency isn't worth much so we couldn't go all out on these builds but still I think they were reasonably spec'd:MOBO: ASUS PRIME B450MCPU: AMD Ryzen 3500XGPU: EVGA/ZOTAC RTX 2060 (the store only had one of each brand)RAM: G.Skillz 16GB 3000Mhz (2x8Gb)PSU: Corsair CV550SSD: WDBlue 500Gb NVMECase: CoolerMaster Q300LOnto the build:I prepared my work surface gathered all the parts and brackets procured the necessary tools (Livestrong bracelet army knife and tweezers) and went to work. I assembled the motherboard for the first one and put it into the case cable-managed closed it up and went ahead to plug it in and POST it.I press the IO button and - voila - I see the POST screen with pride joy and relief. I set XMP up and go forth to the next one.Almost like a deja-vu I assembled the second one cheekily mounted it into the case without POST'ing it (I was 3/3 afterall) inebriated with the feeling of my prior success. I plug it in LEDs light up coolers spin but alas no POST screen. FUCK.Time to check all PSU connections maybe they didn't go all the way in. Nope all clicked and connected. Okay maybe if I plug the monitor into the DVI port instead of HDMI? Costs nothing to try. Yeah that didn't work either. Did the RAM click all the way? Yes. Maybe if I try only one stick? No difference. Okay let's swap RAM sticks with the other PC. The other one still turns on this one still gives no sign. Is the GPU plugged correctly into the PCIe slot? Yes. Okay let's swap GPU's. Still the same. Okay now I'm getting worried. Maybe there's something wrong with the connections to the case? Maybe the USB connector to the front panel is shorting? I've seen some folks having this issue. No no difference when I unplug it. shit shit shit. Let's check all connections again. No signal. Does the MOBO have an issue perhaps? Seems strange the lights turn on and I have spinning coolers. I'm thinking maybe the CPU is at fault? Fuck shouldn't have bought it on Aliexpress. Okay I'll unplug the CPU cooler clean all the goo swap them and check. But before I do that with my patience dwindling and hope hanging by a thread I try to turn it on one last time. And in a couple seconds the monitor lights up a huge ASUS logo shining in front of my eyes. Could it be? I turn it off and on again. The POST screen appears to me yet again. I reset it again and again it comes to greet me. I boot it up and it works flawlessly.Okay I'll consider this a win even though I don't know what went wrong - and what eventually went right. Maybe it was the baby Jesus and the Christmas spirit I'll never know. But I do love your older brother better he didn't make me go through all this when he was your age.Edit: spelling."
"Details about the build:- MSI MEG x570 amd motherboard- amd ryzen 7 3700x (8 core processor)- evga geforce rtx 2070 super gfx card- seasonic prime tx-750 watt power supply- idk if ram is important here but its 2 32gigs of gskills somethin or other.- Be quiet case be quiet cpu cooler.- windows 10The ipad is a 2018 ipad pro. it's big.I've been using the computer for like a week but i've never tried to charge my ipad with it. If I plug my ipad into any of the usb ports on the back of the computer the computer just turns off. If i plug it into a port at the top I get a notification that says "power surge on the usb port unknown usb device more power than the port can supply"Pretty sure all the usb ports are USB 3.1 or 3. i know there are some 2's somewhere but i don't think those are the ones i'm plugging into.So like... did I screw something up here or can i just not plug in my ipad to this computer without it overloading it? Related note- everything has been working fine- games and music/film stuff works ok but how do i know that all the stuff is plugged into the right places and stuff? i don't know if there are supposed to be any like fancy LEDs. I kinda hope not but I don't honestly know how to check my work on this thing. I'm not a scientist. Pretty sure my ram is right- i followed the instructions but... ya know. clearly i may have screwed something up.# *** EDIT ***The plot thickens!So i charged the ipad on wall outlet last night; now its at 100%. i plugged the ipad into every usb port on this computer and all of them were fine.I even tried it with a shitty gas station level cable. completely fine.so all the usb ports are not shorting at least... idk."
"I bought a pre-built pc from a local tech store back in 2014 and I was told it came with a 2TB HDD and a 500GB SSD. Today I had the door open on my case and actually took a close look at the tiny drive in my sata tray for the first time and realized it wasn’t an SSD but it’s actually a little seagate laptop hard drive. Just thought it was funny how the guy that built it’s little lie he told to a 13 year old took so long to get found out. Worst part about it is I just spent the day moving my windows install to what I thought was my “SSD” that actually has slower read and write speeds than the drive it came from 🙃"

"I feel like we're in a weird spot right now with budget GPU's. The older generation superstars (1660 Super for example) are almost sold out and no new ones have been announced for this price category AFAIK. Does anyone know/want to predict when AMD and Nvidia will announce their more low-end graphics cards? I'm talking about the cards around the 200-350 dollar price range. Thank you all!"

"So I have made a website [https://envybits.com/](https://envybits.com/) that can build or upgrade computers automatically with some help of machine learning lots of data entry and plenty of code.Now I know it's not yet optimal so I would like to see if you can beat it and what improvements/changes would you suggest (essentially check how it performs at different budgets and build types). Eg. if it recommends a really bad CPU/GPU combo in a given budget puts too little RAM etc. From my own testing it seems to be doing okay in most situations and can help out people new to it but would like it to be checked by you guys too. In particular "upgrading old computers" part is really hard to check by one person.(Note - US prices are up to date rest of the world is probably not so I would refrain from using them as results may get weird)."

"https://imgur.com/a/63dPkMaThey had one last AMD RX 6900 XT in stockNot pictured is the Ryzen 9 5900xI’m so fucking excited to build this after work tomorrow.EDIT: $1460 for the GPU - https://imgur.com/a/MZbKriBIt’s higher cause it comes overclocked out of the box but also looks like they overbuild the cooling in the card to handle it. Will have to actually see the numbers once I’m done building to see if that $460 was worth it.[Link to card on PowerColor website ](https://www.powercolor.com/product?id=1607314166) Purchase was made at 5:37pm according to my receipt"
"You guys aren’t gonna believe this. So the last piece of my build I was waiting on was my GPU because I bought the $140 Radeon Rx580 off eBay that turned out to be a scam (thanks r/buildapcsales) so I had to order a GPU off amazon. I decided on the EVGA 1660 non-ti for $220. Ordered it next day shipping so I could build. Get home from work today and I got a GeForce RTX 2060 instead.  I know you guys aren’t gonna believe me because how does this happen two days in a row but I can send pictures of the GPU and my amazon order. My only concern is the EVGA seal was already broken on the box but the GPU appears to still be in its wrapping. Is there a way for me to set it up and test it to see if it’s authentic? Is this GPU better than a 1660 (I assume so because it appears to be more expensive)SOS reddit please help this is my first build and I keep encountering weird issuesEdit 1: Heres the picture: https://imgur.com/a/jHKEObVEdit 2: My main concern is over the lack of warranty on this puppy. Also the card was "sealed" with a plastic wrap that says EVGA is this some kinda scam or do the cards usually come like thatEdit 3: FALSE ALARM. I was too excited to actually look at the card. The box is a 2060 box (wtf for?) but my card is actually a 1660. I called EVGA and they checked the serial and everything was good. So unfortunately my luck has run out. Now to actually build this damn pc."
"I just have to vent after this disappointing experience I just had. Hopefully some of you find amusement from this and learn from my mistake.&#x200B;I was planning on assembling my first desktop today. I've done my research and picked out the Ryzen 5 5600x and the ASUS Tuf Gaming x570 MOBO. I was aware that my MOBO would need a system update to work with the latest AMD CPUs but I thought that it wouldn't be an issue. I'll just use a USB to update the bios... oh wait this MOBO does not support USB bios flashback. I misinterpreted the manual and though ASUS EZ flash 3 was the same as flashback. I was wrong. Ooof.No worries I thought. I'll just buy a cheap AMD AM4 socket CPU to perform this update. After getting the $60 AMD Athlon 3000G from amazon I thought I was golden. It even has graphics so I wouldn't need to plug in my GPU to update. So far all seemed perfect.Then the big day came. I opened up all the components that have been sitting in the corner of my room for weeks. The ram slotted perfectly. The PSU and its cables clicked together with ease. The Athlon CPU sat neatly in its socket with a heatsink ontop. I shorted the power switch jumpers and suddenly... nothing happened. The fan was active and there was a red led signifying that the CPU didn't boot right.It turns out that even though the Athlon 3000G is an AM4 CPU which has been out for ages my x570 MOBO doesn't support it. Apparently little to no x570 MOBOs support CPUs before Ryzen 1st gen. I even called around to computer repair shops on my university campus but no dice. No one offers MOBO bios updates as a service.Welp at this point my build day is ruined. I'll try hunting around for compatible CPUs tomorrow but for now my build is stalled.Edit: I wrote this in such haste and annoyance that I didn't proofread anything. I corrected a bunch of spelling.Update: Thanks to all that offered to help by sending me a CPU. I bought a 3600xt from Amazon and received it 5 hours later. Overnight shipping is no joke. They must've had a flux capacitor in the amazon delivery truck to make that insane time. Also I'm having difficulty finding the bios update for my ASUS tuf x570 plus - wifi MOBO. It's almost like their website is down. At least I have a Ryzen 3600xt until I'm able to perform the update. Heres the pcpartpicker list for any of you interested in my soon to be setup. [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yj7ygt](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yj7ygt)Update 2: My build is almost complete. After I received the Ryzen 3600xt everything mostly worked without much troubleshooting. Currently I'm installing Windows 10. I still can't find the correct bios update because the ASUS website decided to have a stroke at the worst possible time. I'll upload pictures of my build tomorrow after I finalize and clean up my setup.Update 3: My build is finished!!! This has been a great (and expensive) learning experience. Here is a link to a couple of pictures I took of the build ([https://imgur.com/a/KW9oMep](https://imgur.com/a/KW9oMep)). Side note the msi rtx 3070 gaming x trio is one beast of a GPU. It barely fits in my case. I even had to move a front fan so it didn't interfere. Although the build is finished that does not mean that I won't update it in the future. Possible future upgrades may include another SSD another monitor a better keyboard more RGB and a large desk pad. That can all wait until black friday though. I'll let my wallet rest for now. This will probobly be the final update unless I break something else."
"I know this will maybe apply to around 2 or 3 people but if you think there may be a hardware problem try using a virus scanner. Windows Defender never picked up the virus but I scanned my PC with Malwarebytes and the infection list was crazy.

"My 4790k has been serving me well for the last 7 years. I intended to upgrade it along with my GPU once the nvidia 3000 series came out last fall…. That didn’t happen lol.In my mind it was still fine and I wouldn’t really see much of a difference. It was a line I’d been telling myself for years but I was so wrong.On a whim I upgraded to a 5600x and some fast DDR4 over the weekend and dear god… I instantly saw a 30% improvement at 1440p steady 100% GPU usage and cool temps… CPU pretty much boosts to 4.6ghz all the time when playing a game.It almost feels like I got a new GPU (currently have a GTX 1080)."

"I've got a fairly high-end system (R5 3600 RTX2070) that my girlfriend loves to commandeer to play The Sims 4 on. It's her favorite game but neither her old HP laptop nor her Macbook can play it well. Experiencing it on a gaming PC was eye-opening and she refuses to go back to that. She's a student(future teacher) and is nearly done with her semester so to celebrate I wanted to build her a rig that will let her play on high-ish settings with a good framerate at 1080p. Something like a machine that would have been considered midrange circa 2014 but with a few modern conveniences added.

A guy on FB was selling the bones of his old gaming PC for $100. 4c/8t Sandy Bridge means we're in business. It idled around 70C in initial testing so I re-pasted it with some Arctic Silver I had leftover. Now it chills at 40C. This also included a case and a SATA cable. I ended up using the cable but ditched the case in favor of a newer one.**4 GB RAM**: Another FB find. This was supposed to be 2x4GB but one of the sticks was DOA :(. Not sure if I fried it or not. He handed it to me with no packaging. Oh well. Benchmarks didn't show any slowdown from having a single-channel extra stick so in it goes.**Case**: Finding this felt serendipitous because I was looking at buying it retail for it's smaller size and price point.  I responded to a 17-week-old-and-forgotten-about listing on FB and got lucky. The materials feel pretty cheap because it is!!! But it breathes well looks ok and has a decent front panel. It was missing some screws and whatever that shielding next to the PCI slots is.Speaking of which add $6 to that total cost for a USB 3.0-to-2.0 header convertor since the motherboard is too old to have 3.0.**SSD**: Here's our first modern touch. A must for snappy performance. I ended up buying this retail. Storage is cheap right now and there weren't any local deals. It's mounted behind the mobo because the case was missing its 2.5" mounting screws.**GPU**: From FB. I didn't feel good about paying $80 for a 750ti but that's the GPU market right now. At least the seller re-pasted it. It's strong enough for The Sims 4 and it runs super cool and quiet to boot.**PSU**: Alright I know not everyone can get one for free. This was a gift from my cousin to whom I gave some parts for his gaming PC last year. It helps to build up some good karma. It's non-modular so I had to stuff a lotta cables in the back of the case.**Wireless adapter**: I went a little crazy here because I wanted WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 capability. Modern conveniences right? For a true barebones budget you can find USB dongles for cheaper.(Not shown: I tried out a cheap Chinese PCIe USB controller to connect the front panel for true USB 3.0 but it would always wake the machine up from shutdown and sleep after 3 seconds. Oh well.)*Performance*It scores about 4000 in Fire Strike and 12500 in Night Raid. More importantly it stays around 50-70 FPS in Sims 4 with a few visual effects turned down. For shits and giggles I fired up Doom 2016 and managed to get about 35 fps on 1080p high in Vulkan lolWeb browsing and general desktop stuff is very responsive not much slower than my own machine. Overall I was kinda blown away by how well this 10 year old processor is holding up.---This thing ended up being a lot of fun to assemble. I really liked finding a use for old hardware that might have gone to waste otherwise. And it was nice going through the build process without having to stress over the large dollar amounts that comes with new tech.I'm planning to give it to her after her finals are done and she has the time to play. Thanks for reading.PS if anybody knows where I can find a cover for that open space next to the PCIe slots I'd really appreciate it"

"I was shit scared of breaking something before i started building my hand was shaking as i put the cpu in. I made a few mistakes with cables and cable management and the back of my rig looks garbage but the fronts clean and it just feels so good. Im sorry for posting like this but it feels so good to type it all out and not feel like im bragging to my friends"
"So i've had this issue for probably close to 3 years now and could not figure it out for the life of me. Essentially the problem was that when i had a video or really any kind of motion on my secondary or third monitor be it a 144hz or 60hz (Main display is 144hz) display the game on my primary display would feel super choppy and sluggish. I have tried everything from changing cables hardware software settings  you name it i've probably done it. So eventually i gave up and just lived with having to pause things when i was in a game or just listen to videos minimized or have them play between rounds etc etc...After coming back to this subject from time to time for years i found some legendary human being in a comments section of some random tech article who replied to someone who had the same issue as me with a solution! Fair this might not work for everyone but its worth a shot! The solution was simply a hidden nvidia driver setting removed from the control panel a long time ago.Now finally the solution for those who dont care about my silly rant lol.&#x200B;**!!!  SOLUTION  !!!** \- For me anyways :)**-----------------------------------------------------**\- First install **nvidiaProfileInspector** either a quick google will find you the link or click here: [https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases)\- Click on whatever the newest version is then download the .zip file by simply clicking on it.\- After the .zip file is download simply unzip it / drag the .exe file out of the .zip file onto your desktop or elsewhere.\- Run **nvidiaProfileInspector** as administrator.\- Go down to "5 - Common" the setting your looking for is **Multi-display/Mixed-GPU acceleration**\- Now for me it was set to "single display performance mode" i changed it to "Multi display performance mode"\- Click apply changes on the top right\- Reboot pc make sure changes stuck and BAM!\- Enjoy peace serenity zen joy the finer things in life now you are finally free from that terrible problem.**-----------------------------------------------------****!!!  Side Notes  !!!****-----------------------------------------------------****- Important you use NvidiaProfileInspector and not NvidiaInspector!!**\- Reference picture for the setting : [http://prntscr.com/10gjq2y](http://prntscr.com/10gjq2y)\- On said article where i found this someone else mentioned that they had to do the opposite to me and change it from multi to single so its worth trying all the settings.\- The settings will likely be greyed out don't worry simply click on it and the drop down will appear and you can change the setting.\- For me the effects took place instantly after clicking apply changes and i had no reboot required your mileage may vary.**-----------------------------------------------------**&#x200B;Finally I hope this helps someone out there and makes your pc experience that much better!&#x200B;**!!!  UPDATE  !!!****-----------------------------------------------------**So a few more things that have been mentioned a bunch in the comments that i felt the need to add to the post:\- People have mentioned changing monitor refresh rates to ones that coincide with one another for example change the 144hz to 120hz to fit with a 60hz secondary display. For me this did nothing and i currently have two 144hz display and one 60hz display. Before my solution regardless of what monitor the content would play on i would have the same issue. So i don't believe it's all that related to the refresh rate of the monitors.\- Hardware acceleration. I have it all turned off at first it did nothing for me however it could be a matter of having this off along with the control panel setting. If you need to know where to find it a quick google shall save you.\- After doing the changes and applying you can press Win+Ctrl+Shift+B to instantly refresh your driver i did not know this credit to u/MinodRP and u/fdoom. Probably worth doing after changing the setting.\- Been some mention of discord and discord streaming. This has not had any negative effects towards viewing or streaming with discord only positives as in it stops it from stuttering.\-  Some people have mentioned turning off geforce capture such as instant replay fixed it for them. Didn't effect anything for me however.\- Running games in fullscreen is certainly a work around but as i have stated to many people i wanted a solution not a work around. :)\- I have done all this with an i7-8700 rtx 2070 two predator 144hz monitors one with gsync one without and one acer 60hz display. All my drivers are up to date along side windows. My current Nvidia driver as of writing is 461.72. After the fix everything is working flawlessly.\- Gsync and any form of vsync did not have any effect for me currently i have it set to gsync for windowed and fullscreen and everything is working fine with my fix. But prior it was of no help.\- As for this fix staying with geforce driver updates i believe it should as with most other control panel settings because that's essentially what this is however only time will tell as i am currently on the latest drivers and have no way of testing.\- Unfortunately team Red i got nothing for you I'm rather unfamiliar with AMD cards and hardware and have no further information for you. Should i happen to find something usefull in the comments i will add it to the post!\- One more thing in my nvidia control panel under display setting so have everything being rendered by my gpu not integrated.**-----------------------------------------------------**Finally i am glad this has been of much use to so many people i am going to make it a point from now on for my self that anytime i find a solution to some stupid bizarre problem i will make a post stating said solution provided there isn't one at the time. Considering this i believe my first post to reddit i am blown away by all the awards and medals and everything especially u/Altan1337 thank you so much for the platinum it means allot to me.For everyone this has worked for i hope you can now enjoy stutter free gaming along side me. :)"
"I know it seems like child's play when you have built several PCs for home use.  I see so many people here asking for advice on building a PC for the office.  It seems like a great way to show off your skills and possibly advance your career.  It is a risk you really don't want to take or be responsible for.  Yes it may work out great but in heavy use and over years may fail.  Then becomes your responsibility every time it fails.  This is where you want to purchase from a reputable company with a service agreement that will fix the PC as needed.  These PCs are usually put together with workstation components that are less likely to fail.  But they are responsible when it does.  Don't take the risk for short term gain.  Edit: The post is geared towards high end workstations.  "

"I have been wanting a PC to play casual games on for about  9 years but was never able to convince my parents to buy me even an extremely budget one. but now im 16 and I've finally saved up enough to build a gaming PC. I have ordered all the parts and almost everything is here except power supply the CPU i got came with a broken pin out of the box so i have to replace that and thats going to delay the build even further which is a shame. but regardless of all these inconveniences dont think I've ever been happier. its pretty much been my dream to have a PC I never cared how cheap it was I was wiling to spend even as low as $100 just to have something to play on. its something I've only ever dreamt of and now its finally slowly becoming a reality. :DThe PC i am building is around $350 give or takeHere are the specs (pls don't judge ya bois broke)CPU - Ryzen 3 3300x🟩GPU - GeForce GTX 1050 Ti.

"To start I want to introduce a memory naming convention that many of you are likely unfamiliar with: **Binary**. Well I know you've heard the word *binary* but you likely haven't seen it used properly when talking about hard drives. Here are a few examples:* Kibibyte* Mebibyte* Gibibyte* TebibyteNotice these are similar to what you normally see - Ki*lo*byte Me*ga*byte Gi*ga*byte Te*ra*byte. What most people don't realize; this naming convention we're used to is actually for **decimal** measurements (for hard drives). Decimal and Binary have slightly different suffixes:Decimal| Binary---|---KB| KiBMB| MiBGB| GiBTB | TiBSo what's the actual difference between the two? Well many of you know that there's 1024 bytes in a kilobyte (excuse me kibibyte). That number can also be expressed as 2^10 (2 to the power of 10). It's *close* to the clean number we know to be 1000 but it's still off just slightly.For Decimal we *do* use a clean 1000 bytes per Kilobytes. Properly expressed as 10^3 (10 to the power of 3).This discrepancy has always existed when it comes to storage devices (specifically hard drives). Back in the 50's the [IBM 350](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_350) stored 5000000 "characters" exactly (a round decimal number instead of binary) because it made more sense to have 50 platters each with 1000 sectors each of *those* storing 100 characters.___So the actual discrepancy. How does it come up and why is it seemingly so large? The answer: Windows has alway been keen on representing it's storage space in Binary as opposed to Decimal.Let's look at the some of the size discrepancies between Binary and Decimal each of them represented by the number of bytes.Capacity| Decimal | Binary | Decimal Bytes | Binary Bytes | % Diff:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:Kilo / Kibi | 1000^1 | 1024^1 | 1000 | 1024 | 2.4%Mega / Mebi | 1000^2 | 1024^2 | 1000000 | 1048576 | 4.9%Giga / Gibi | 1000^3 | 1024^3 | 1000000000 | 1073741824 | 7.4%Tera / Tebi| 1000^4 | 1024^4 | 1000000000000 | 1099511627776 | 10.0%You may notice as we step up in capacity the gap between Decimal and Binary gets wider. We start off with a 2.4% difference with Kilo and Kibi and it grows to a 10% difference between Tera and Tebi.___Now for the hard drive itself. As I mention hard drives are are manufactured and *advertised* a with the **Decimal** measurement. If you buy a 1TB hard drive it will have 1000000000000 bytes. (Side note: this is the case with SSDs too in spite of using binary based flash memory).Now remember; Windows views storage capacity in Binary. Therefore it has to convert 1000000000000 bytes to the binary form of Gibibytes.The Final math:* 1 terabyte (1000000000000)* divide by the amount of bytes in a gibibtye (1073741824)**Your answer:** 931.323 Gibibytes (or as windows will tell you Gigabytes).LPT: Google has the binary identifiers built into its search algorith. So you can do this yourself:  https://www.google.com/search?q=1TB+to+GiB"

" I was a console player for about 20+ years and all of my friends have left over the years. After getting tired of constantly playing games solo I finally made the jump to pc. Its been years since I played pc games (vanilla Wow at original launch) and didnt know my way around to build one. I went and bought a prebuilt system just bcuz i was too afraid to try and build my own pc from scratch. Its been about 4 months since I made the switch and I have completely gutted the prebuilt and put all of my own parts in it. Doing this has made me a lot more satisfied with the performance but I ended up spending double or even triple than what i would have spent had i just built in the first place. So if you're new to pc like me dont be intimidated. Theres plenty of guides and videos to walk you through everything. It'll be more worth it in the end in pretty much every way"
"I was doing an upgrade new R5 3600 new 5700xt. Found out I needed a new power supply went from a EVGA 550w to a Seasonic 650w had a truly fun time changing parts out and reorganizing cables. It was a fun Friday night. Now here’s where I have a problem.I reused the Sata cable from EVGA because I didn’t want to pull the drives and mess with any of that. Closed it all up and tried turning it on...and heard a pop. 8 hours and 6 tear downs later 2 HDD and 1 SSD are fried. Over 6tb of drives are kaput they won’t even spin up as best I can tell...turns out the SATA cables for Seasonic are completely different than EVGA cables. We aren’t just talking about games saves and Plex servers and normal things you don’t want to lose I’ve lost all the pictures and videos my wife and I took for the last 11 years of our lives together every picture of ours kids growing up every first video of anything ever. Pictures and videos of her last visit with her Grandfather all of the copies of important paperwork. One of these drives was our backup while we put together a true server I never thought anything would happen to this drive. I’m devastated.We’ve been doing some googling and some people say that you can rebuild drives if you get the exact same model...and have a clean room...is there any truth to that? Does anyone have any experience? I’m desperate.(Update: Lots and lots of comments with quite a lot of points I’d like to respond to. I saved up for 6 months to buy these new parts I’m donating my old parts to my daughters for a decent system for them to play and do schoolwork on. I can’t return these parts just to have to buy them again later. The data will keep I hope and I can do something about this another day. To those pushing cloud storage I don’t trust it on my iPhone I certainly won’t trust it with sensitive documents and pictures of my children and frankly my wife’s nudes. We all saw the fallout from the Fappening. I also can’t put all of my stuff into a cloud because I had my plex server on that drive...and I’m positive you understand my meaning.I also can’t pay extra for “offsite” secure storage because of other obligations to my family. My oldest daughter is type 1 diabetic and that’s why I had to save for so long before buying my parts. I have emergency funds that I will NOT dip into for something like this when there are far more important emergencies I have to watch out for just last week I had dip into the fund to buy a new tire for my car after a blowout to get back and forth to work and had to replace that money this week.Some people offered to help fund the recovery. You are the best of our community I appreciate you more than you could believe. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I don’t know that I can justify you doing that for such a trivial thing.Someone linked a site that has replacement PCB’s I’m going to try that first as that should be the only real problem. Also that’s significantly cheaper. The ssd I’m not worried about. It only held games one 4tb drive held the important items I’m going to start there. The 2tb drive was mostly just overflow and unorganized crap I didn’t know what to do with. Wish me luck."
"Wanted to share a funny story. Keep in mind I'm still fairly new to overclocking. Earlier today I was poking around Ryzen Master and noticed that the "Memory Control" was set to 1500 MHz. I think to myself "I have to change this my RAM kit is good for 3000 MHz my RAM must be underclocked!" so I crank that bad boy up to 3000 MHz effectively attempting to OC the RAM to 6000 MHz. It did not go well. I had to perform a CMOS reset to get my rig to boot again. Sharing this so that OC newbies like myself don't make the same mistake I did."
"The team over at LTT (Linus Tech Tips) yesterday uploaded this extensive 'How to build a PC' guide over on their main YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/BL4DCEp7blY (1 Hour 42 Minutes) Having watched through the entire video I believe that this video would be a great resource to have pinned to the sub. The LTT team have done a really good job with this one good step by step instructions as well as offering some really helpful advice & guidance on the overall build process. Having this pinned somewhere that's easy for any new or curious PC builders out there to find would be a really helpful starting point for them."

"Every single build help post I see recommends a B450 Tomahawk carbon pro or similar over an X570 to save money on a new Ryzen 3000 build without the caveat that right now these boards are suffering [multiple various issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/ce3ift/msi_b450_tomahawk_update/) that are unlikely to be fixed until the end of the month (at least).MSI have just announced a new range of B450 MAX boards to address some of the problems but there are no lead times/prices and they may still suffer with issues until the BIOS are fixed. There are a lot of motherboards out there.People here may have upgraded their board with 0 problems but for new people asking for help it’s not ok to potentially leave them stuck with a shiny new dead build and a 2-3 weeks wait for any fix.We get it - the X570 boards are expensive as hell most of us don’t care about PCIe 4.0 but please stop giving plain bad advice until we can be sure about the older boards"
"I have built and rebuilt this computer a dozen times. Today I was rebuilding it into a new case. Reversed the power and reset headers. Power didn’t turn the PC on hit the reset switch and instant smoke from the ram. Hope to god I can salvage my HDD and SSDs or else 10 years of musical ideas will be gone. FML. It’s 4:00am. Goodnight.Edit #1: Wow this kinda blew up while I was sleeping. Thanks to everyone who replied. So it seems that I was wrong about the power/reset headers being the issue. When I took everything apart I realized I did not plug in the 3 pin AIO cooler header correctly to the 4 pin CPU fan header on the mobo. There are plastic grooves that guide it to the correct side but I managed to still mess it up... Not sure what I should do now. Attempt to get it to post with only the CPU mobo psu and cooler?Edit #2: I tried to get it to post just using the MOBO CPU PSU and AIO but it boots for a second then turns off. I located a small component maybe diode or resistor near the CPU_Fan header that looks melted and the standoff mounting hole close to that looks a little bubbled and darker than it should be. I ordered a Sata/USB 3.0 adapter to test the drives. Should come in a couple of days.Edit #3: The adapter arrived. The HDD and SSDs are okay! Unsure about the rest of the hardware. It will be a while until I can test it."
"https://imgur.com/gallery/IcTDLRIWas walking out the door and saw the letters Ti sticking out of one of the totes the employees bring out new stock in.Freaked out when I saw the price was $20.

But I’ll lose $20 with a quickness on a strong possibility that it works.The card in the box wasn’t a 1080tiIt was a ....Evga gtx Titan 6GBIt was in an antistatic bag . Which if it was a busted card why worry about static electricity?Fairly dusty but that can easily be resolvedFingers crossed it works.Will be upgrading from a msi r7 370 if it does—————————————-Edit: Results are inSo finally got everything situatedAnd.....

Best of luck to everyone in their search for bargains and such—————————————-Edit4:Welp....the night I got the graphics card I stress tested it with furmark(I believe ?) had it set to shut down if the card hit 80C . Which it did after 20 minutes or so.Didn’t try to turn my PC back on until this morning. Andddd. *drum roll*It won’t turn on at all. Unplugged it and pulled the CMOS battery. Nothing. Tried the power button that’s on the physical Mobo. LED lights up while my finger is on the button. But no power.Not sure what’s at fault. But I knew Something had to go wrong. YupEdit 5:  not sure if I should make a new post if no one responds I guesss I will.Small recap... while benchmarking the Titan I blew my power supply. So I decided to drop the extra coin and build a new system since I was working with a 9+yr old cpu. Ryzen 2600 w/ the stock cooler that comes with the 3800x16GB Ddr4 RAM 2933MHz I believe Msi tomahawk b450 Evga 800watt modular power supply  Gtx Titan 6Gb At first I thought the Titan died with my power supply . Took it apart. Cleaned everything and applied much need new thermal grease. Put it back together and still nothing.... And then I moved the card from the PCI_E 3.0 slot down to the PCI_E 2.0 slot. And just like that. I had video again.  Problem solved.... sorta. I’d really like the card to work in the 3.0 slot. Performance gains aside It would also give it more room for airflow. The 2.0 slot is just above the PSU. Any idea why it won’t work in the 3.0 slot? Do I have a mobo with a dead pcie slot? Am I missing something in bios ? Thank you for any and all responses"
"I see [posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/at80gc/ryzen_5_2600x3600_with_rtx_2060_6gb/) multiple times a day where OP is asking about a CPU and GPU that will be a great match but "the GPU will be bottlenecked by the CPU" and that's bad right??No. Bottlenecks are normal. Either your CPU or GPU will be maxed out during demanding games and limit the FPS that you can get. At least 80% of computers are bottlenecked by the GPU because 60fps gaming doesn't put much strain on the CPU on most games. That's completely fine.With 144hz gaming having a powerful CPU is going to be important. But that's a discussion for the comments.If you still don't understand what bottlenecking is just stop using the word completely and forget its a thing. If you do understand what bottlenecking is may your FPS be high and your temps be low.**Edit: My post isn't really that informative and there is great info on the comments. To clarify most of the time the GPU being the bottleneck is normal and good. If a CPU is a bottleneck and there is no stuttering or other issues that's not a problem. If a CPU is a bottleneck and is seeing 90%+ utilization AND is causing freezing and other issues turn down the power limit of the GPU on MSI afterburner until things smooth out. Or even better if the game allows for a FPS cap to be set do that.**"

"Ive been struggling for the last year with my Asrock Challenger 5700xt. It sounded like a freaking jet turbine when under heavy load and i would have to manually undervolt it and set the fan curve higher to keep its temperature under control.Under load its junction temp would basically peg itself at 110 Celsius with its average temp usually around 80-90 Celsius.  It would occasionally hard crash the system. I got it for around $230 new so i basically decided I cheaped out too much and should have gotten a Sapphire card like i was originally planning on.Well you know how the graphics car market has gotten…Today i finally had enough and took it out and disassembled it.It was easier than i expected with the cooler only held on by the 4 screws on the mounting bracket.This is what i found…Whole sections of the die didn't have thermal paste and the consistency was basically like dried toothpaste on your sink counter.I was impatient and went to Best Buy and grabbed the best thermal paste they had in stock. [Corsair XTM50](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/corsair-xtm50-high-performance-thermal-paste-kit-gray/6356251.p?skuId=6356251)I know its not the absolute best thermal paste out there but it was available. They price matched it at ~$12 online for the tube.Anyway I applied that generously reinstalled the card and put it on a stress test for 10 minutes running Gigapixel AI on a bunch of high resolution photos to essentially peg it at 100% for 10 minutes.Results:Near silent fan noise.GPU average maxed out at 55 CelsiusGPU junction maxed out at 77 celciusThat's a >30 Celsius difference! Holy crap.Check your factory thermal paste. It might be hot (literally) garbage.https://imgur.com/a/DxQiqJvEDIT:ALso the Idle temps used to be in the low 50's Celcius and they are now 31 Celcius."

There is little joy here.[LINK TO PREVIOUS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/603lna/just_purchased_a_1tb_ssd_on_amazon_for_93_in_new/)So for those out of the loop. 3 days ago I asked /r/buildapc if I was screwed out of $100 by an Amazon third party seller having purchased a 1TB SSD (Crucial MX300) for that small sum of change (I mean relatively speaking.) I had an *overwhelming* amount of support from the community and I wanted to start off fore-mostly by saying thank you to everyone in that post!So the day after that post I received an email from Amazon:HelloWe're writing to let you know we processed your refund of $97.98 for your Order 002-8081220-8465036 from **REDACTED BY /u/KABRANDON**.This refund is for the following item(s):    Item: Crucial MX300 1TB SATA 2.5 Inch Internal Solid State Drive - CT1050MX300SSD1    Quantity: 1    ASIN: B01IAGSDUE    Reason for refund: Account adjustment    Here's the breakdown of your refund for this item:        Item Refund: $92.99        Shipping Refund: $4.99Aaaaaaaannnnd end email.So I didn't ask for this refund but it happened automagically as far as I'm aware. I have no idea what "account adjustment" means. But anyway I didn't believe it because when I look at the Amazon website under my orders it says nothing on that order page about any change in the order. No mention of refunds etc etc. Fast forward to this morning I receive the money in my bank account. So I'm assuming it must be updated in my orders... Nope it's still there. But it's stuck in the "Transit to Carrier" stage. Overall I'm guessing it was indeed a scam Amazon recognized it for my stupid self and gave me my money back. I don't think I'm ever getting this SSD but it is what it is.tl;dr Didn't get my SSD (yet but probably will not ever.) But I got a refund that I didn't ask for.edit: A bunch of stuff came in from Amazon today... No SSD but I got 2 electric water kettles which is kind of strange. I mean I ordered one of them.edit2: Thank you again to the community! A kind user /u/-Mateo- offered to sell me his 750GB Crucial MX300 for pretty cheap. Thanks /u/-Mateo-!"
"I built my first AMD build with the 3900x back in October. I was happy it ran well only issue was it ran a little hot (idle usually around 50 got up to over 100 somehow at its hottest without throttling). Whatever I thought I’m just using the stock cooler until I get my real cooler.Well today I go to install my real cooler. I’ve heard AMD can be difficult to remove the heat sinks so I ran a prime95 to get the thermal paste nice and loose. I go to remove the cooler and it feels loose so I’m happy. Then I’m trying to figure out how to take it off. The little lever is moving around but it doesn’t seem to be releasing the retention arms. Finally I encounter AMDs website where it said to unlock the lever. I can’t figure how I’m supposed to do that but they included a diagram. The way I was pushing the lever to try to move the arms was to the locked position. When I did that it sealed and wasn’t loose anymore. My heart sank. For 6 months I’ve been using this computer with the cooler just loosely contacting the processor. That’s probably why my temps were so high.  At least it somehow never throttled itself."
"DDR4 launched at 2133MHz CL15 at a time when 2400MHz CL11 DDR3 was common. This led to some instances where a 4790K + DDR3 was outperforming the 6700K + DDR4 in memory intensive tasks. DDR5 most likely won't be a magical instant leap in performance. It will need a few years to mature and beat high end DDR4.Edit - I'm trying to say don't be worried about buying into DDR4 now it'll take a while for DDR5 to match it on price and performance.I also think a lot of people in this thread don't actually remember how cheap good DDR3 got towards the end of it's life cycle and how expensive DDR4 was even for base speeds. You could buy DDR3 2133/2400 for cheaper than DDR4 2133 back when DDR4 first launched. "

"Hi /r/buildapc! I finally finished building my PC "Matilda" and I'm super excited about how she turned out.**[Pictures of build here](https://imgur.com/a/4brjHQb)**edit: [Added pusheen](https://i.redd.it/ayu1f9mcp9261.jpg)**An ode to this subreddit**I got a little emotional building because it really took me on a trip down memory lane. I built my first PC ever in 2012. I had a strict budget of $400 ([here's](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/vivixn/saved/#view=j786rH) a list of the parts if anyone's curious). This subreddit (yes 8 years ago) was so kind and helped me with picking out parts! I ended up with no graphics card -- the best game I could run was Minecraft but I still had loads of fun. That PC took me through all of high school until I moved away for undergrad and now my little brother still uses it to this day. I eventually bought an SSD for it and he bought some better RAM. I'm honestly amazed at how much value this PC gave and continues to give.Fast forward 8 years and now I'm able to budget much more for building a PC. Honestly not sure if it was the best idea because I ended up being much more conscious of aesthetics due to side-panel cases. **Picking parts!**I started this build with the be quiet! 500DX case -- I'm happy to report that it lives up to its name and Matilda is indeed quiet. I was also insane/lucky enough to stalk Newegg and get my hands on a 3080.  I decided to build with a Ryzen 3600 because I got it on sale and the CPU supply/demand situation is pretty crazy right now. Maybe I'll go for a 5000 series when things settle down.This case is somewhat unique because it has a white interior (many white cases have a dark/black interior) and it did influence how I chose my parts. I decided on a black-into-white (panda?) theme so I tried to keep most parts in this case black so I could run white PSU extension cables as a "transition".**Thoughts while building**Build-wise it went about as smooth as it could have! I was definitely rusty so if I could do it again I would (1) peel off the sticker on the CPU cooler BEFORE installing it on the CPU and (2) plug the CPU power cables in the mobo before mounting it on the case (3) plug in the front panel I/O before installing the GPU and (4) plug in and secure all of the necessary PSU cables into the PSU before putting the PSU in the case.**Cable management**The case was nice to build in -- only hiccup was the amount of force required to get the front panel off but at least you can use all the force you want since there is no cable connecting the front panel to the rest of the case. I tried my best at cable management and tried to make it as clean as possible. I'm really happy with the PSU extensions. They do bulk up the cables in the back of the case but you can make it work™. I also had to snip some 24-pin combs to make the two 8-pin GPU power cables look like one 16-pin cable.**Parts list**[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2rKL7X)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9nm323/amd-ryzen-5-3600-36-thz-6-core-processor-100-100000031box) | Purchased For $174.99 **CPU Cooler** | [Scythe FUMA 2 51.17 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/YsHRsY/scythe-fuma-2-5117-cfm-cpu-cooler-scfm-2000) | Purchased For $59.99 **Motherboard** | [MSI MAG X570 TOMAHAWK WIFI ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WKdrxr/msi-mag-x570-tomahawk-wifi-atx-am4-motherboard-mag-x570-tomahawk-wifi) | Purchased For $197.99 **Memory** | [Crucial Ballistix RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qwDkcf/crucial-ballistix-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3200-memory-bl2k16g32c16u4bl) | Purchased For $127.99 **Storage** | [SK hynix Gold P31 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/xNCFf7/sk-hynix-gold-p31-1-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-shgp31-1000gm-2) | Purchased For $107.99 **Video Card** | [Asus GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB TUF GAMING Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/DgMTwP/asus-geforce-rtx-3080-10-gb-tuf-gaming-video-card-tuf-rtx3080-10g-gaming) | Purchased For $756.98 **Case** | [be quiet!

Not bad actually. 1700$ overpriced on their top model. In conclusion alienware's target audience is hardware illiterate people who don't do research before they buy. It's not *horrible* considering they *DO* have a decent return policy but please please don't buy an alienware. It's just not worth it. Nothing wrong with prebuilts and nothing wrong with alienware (I guess) but if you read this and still buy an alienware well that's buying into the brand. Edit: told by people to say : Dell does have decent customer support. It's really up to buyer if the luxury and ease of a pre built is worth the hundreds they pay"
"Here it is waiting since August for the RTX 3000 series launch I finally managed to get a 3070. Also grabbed a 5600x instead of 3700x in the journey. Funny thing is that I got tired of trying to buy a 3070 and decided to just buy the other components and stay with my 1050ti for a while longer. Then one day I went to check the shipping on my motherboard and the buy option was available for the Ventus x3 (yes the first search result on my browser is the 3070 because I checked that link 1000 times). I didn't want to celebrate yet because it was coming in 1 month. But it finally came it was worth the wait :DHere's my setup: https://imgur.com/a/jH3UvXsUserBenchmark: https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/39713290My components: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/jHrVHzI tried to hide cables as much as possible.

"Hello Everyone after a lucky stock drop ~~last Wednesday~~ (**edit** Wednesday the 3rd wrote this up a while ago) I managed to secure myself a great GPU at a great price in the form of a RTX 3070 founder's edition.This is the last major piece of my first gaming PC build ever replacing my 10 year old laptop that just wasn't up to scratch anymore (or in hindsight really ever. Still I love that old dinosaur).Reading /r/buildapc helped me select my parts and avoid various traps and troubles along the way super grateful to the very knowledgeable builders here and everywhere who do the research and share their experience with us n00bs.**The Build**Living in Jersey means that while some shippers wont send things here at all (looking at you Curry's) other shipper will remove VAT giving me some options at great bargains.The other stroke of luck I had was that I bought a random selection of PC parts of a local for £30 last year. One of those items was a Galaxy 1060 3GB which worked fine after testing on a friend's rig so I able to mostly build this in January and still have a nice working PC for when I was able to get a new GPU.The build went fairly smoothly 1 hour to get everything in 1 hour to trouble shoot why I couldn't install windows (hadn't fully inserted the M.2) and 2 hours cable managing and re-cable managing until I was satisfied.No other major dramas except some Arctic F12s that arrived completely broken.Super happy with this build now and hope it lasts me a good many years.

"It really fucking irks me when some dumbass claims that people who say they need Ryzen for video editing and photoshop are just "making excuses for buying something fancy."Why can't people understand that people actually fucking do video editing and photoshop. Gaming is not the only activity that is performed on a PC. I get that a lot of people here myself included do a lot of gaming so gaming related build advice makes sense for that.But to outright claim that people don't legitimately and seriously do other tasks on their PC is fucking moronic and this attitude needs to stop."
"This is my case. When I was looking for parts I cared about aesthetic too and definitely paid the price for it. Now after 1 year owning my first ever gaming PC I only care about performance fps and gaming experience in general. Is this also your case? Just comment with your aesthetic/performance % balance since when you’re in the “PC master race” and your thoughts if you want so curious!EDIT: as I see it: acoustic thermals reliability and longevity ARE performance factors.EDIT2: Seems like who built his first PCs more caring about one thing now wants the other. That’s interesting."
"Inspired by my own tale of woe which started by me googling "endgame gear xm1 middle click issues" "endgame gear xm1 mouse roll difficult click" worrying whether my copy of this often recommended mouse had some defects (I bought it only about 3 months ago) or maybe I was used to lighter click than the reviewers. Then not finding any useful results followed by weeks of frustration. Finally I had an epiphany when I saw my cat jump on the desk and lose some fur around the mouse.[The gory insides of XM1](https://i.imgur.com/LH2ALIG.jpg)[Removed fur rolls](https://i.imgur.com/ydAXcEa.jpg)Hope this saves people some time and frustration. And I beat myself up for not coming up with the solution sooner - I grew up in a time when removing lint from mouse ball rollers was a monthly chore.Edit: It seems a lot of people are afraid / don't know how to take apart a mouse. I understand the confusion - removing the sticky pads to reveal the screws can be scary if you're doing it for the first time to an expensive piece of hardware. A lot of useful advice in the comments but my general method is to Google 'X disassembly' where X=brand and model of the hardware. In my case I just followed [this YouTube video about Endgame Gear XM1 disassembly](https://youtu.be/AjGql7S9ccY)."
"If I buy a $450 GPU and its mail-in rebate is $30 the GPU is still $450 now $420. First of all you if you get the rebate it'll come 8-12 weeks later. Depending on where you buy the product from you might not get the rebate. I followed the rebate instructions to a T and it was rejected. Others had the same issue. Rebates are hit or miss. I also can't put the prepaid card in my bank account. Its on a visa card.When recommending a build don't count the $100 in savings as rebates thats not cool"
"Recently ive been getting drops in FPS in rocket league and Bannerlord and even crashes related to GPU stress. No idea what can happened or if i've turned a magic 'turn my pc to shit' button somewhere but last 2/3 months my PC is running so baly when playing games.

Felt like going all in and gave myself a clean copy of windows aswell. Feels like a brand new computer. Thanks again for all the advice!"
"Apologies if this is the wrong place. I sold a new GPU buyer tries to install and tells me it broke. Messages me to try to get me to RMA it from company I bought it from. I know i don't have to do anything as its not my responsibility. I'm guessing I couldn't/shouldn't do what he asks even if I wanted to. Is this a scam at all?Edit:With all replies I just wanted to add more information.  I sold the card for the same price I bought no scalping. It was face to face cash transaction.The buyer is more knowledgeable than me about pc parts etc he told me to RMA it before I even knew what an RMA is. He said he has dealt with the company i bought it from many times.I do want to help just don't want to be scammed.Thank you for everyone's help. It is greatly appreciated.Edit 2: The buyer has been given proof of purchase and has been guided to take it up with manufacturer.Another thanks to everyone that helped. I know this is a small dispute but your advice really has put my worries at ease. Those that call me a 'scalper' despite me selling for the same price I paid for. I was planning to use this card (3070) in my future build but I managed to secure a 3080. I didn't find it right to sell for more money. I thought it would be the right thing to do."
"I'm working with my brothers wife on this one. My brother has a serious gaming problem. He has an addictive personality and this has been going on for a year. She wants me to take his whole tower but I'd really rather not do that. I fear he'd buy another one. He has been neglecting his wife and one year old son and I think he needs a wake up call. After talking to her I understand she is very close to leaving him. I love my brother and if I can help I will. What's something I can do to temporarily disable his PC without causing damage? He spent a lot of money on his computer but honestly he's not very savvy with it.I'm not going to add more specific reasoning.  I'm not sure of his activity level on reddit or if he's in this sub. It's possible. Please just know this is a serious problem that involves both families. I have a $4k PC myself and I'd much rather someone disable mine to spark a discussion than remove it completely/sell it/destroy it.EDIT: enough of you have chimed in saying I shouldn't do this and I appreciate that feedback. I won't mess with his computer. I'll recommend his family doesn't either. I'm try to promote a more direct solution based on communication and criticism even if it may be harsh."
"Holy basically I had a EVGA GTX 750 Ti which is severely outdated for modern games. After contemplating upgrading I decided to buy a used RX 570 for cheap 2nd hand and wait for the next gen stuff. Thought it was a simple plug and play situation. NOPE. Make sure you absolutely delete EVERYTHING on your comp having to do with NVIDIA before trying to install an AMD GPU. I messed my rig up real nice. Kept freezing at the windows sign in screen. Even slotting the 750 Ti back in didn't fix it. Also had doubts I bought a faulty used card. In the end I had to reinstall windows after hours of debugging. TLDR always clean up previous drivers before installing when switching from Nvidia to AMD or vice versa."
"So I'm 13 and for my science fair project I decided to compare results on overclocks through different cooling solutions. While swapping the cooler someway somehow a few pins on my CPU got bent and my PC wouldn't boot. Being 13 I know that if I don't get this fixed I won't have a working PC for a bit until my parents let me get a new CPU so I went to work. A knife and a jayztwocents video later I dropped my CPU back in the socket crossed my fingers and pressed the power button...low and behold it booted and I am proud of myself"
"Not sure how common this is or how it's even possible...[https://imgur.com/a/fH3YnRw](https://imgur.com/a/fH3YnRw) Ebay seller was listing a 1080 ti for $315 I fell for it. To be even more stupid I offered $300. To my surprise the offer was accepted this morning.But sometime after my offer was submitted and before my offer was accepted the seller increased the shipping charges from $13.40 to $760.40. I didn't pay for it. But just another reminder eBay is full of scammers and I hope no one falls victim by hitting the pay button before realizing the seller changed the shipping fees."

"I fucked up. I was trying to take my gpu out and was struggling for a good hour. The little clip that holds it in place for some reason had the resistance of a fucking Boulder and I had barely any wiggle room to work my finger in. So I went to google and hear people try an eraser head or lo and behold a chopstick. I jammed that fucker right in and it ends up slipping and slamming right in the middle of my ssd. Bent that sucker right in half. I hate my life."

"I am currently a console gamer planning on building a pc. I've been putting together lists of everything I need and it seems like on most pc subreddits (excluding this one you guys are all so nice) people are overly elitist. Like for example I was looking for reviews for a gaming chair that was in my budget first thing I see is "get a 300 pound office chair" when I'm not in a position to spend 300 on a chair. I was looking for a wireless gaming headset review and the first thing I see in the comments is "why would you want wireless just get a wired headset that's more expensive" I understand when it's an open question but if I'm asking for opinions on a headset just tell me if it's not good and give me an alternative. I have my reasons for needing a wireless headset and I have a reason for not wanting to spend 300 on a used chair. I'm sorry if this comes off a bit dumb I just wanted to speak my mind. Thank you."

"He went from struggling to get 75 FPS in Fortnite to getting 250 FPS. More importantly he’s able to play some other games. You guys are great. Thank you so much. It was so fun to build.Update: lots of posts mad that I said “struggling to get 75 FPS”. I was just using it to show the difference between what we had and what we now have. I’m grateful for the old computer and still happily using it. We can play some games together! We have no complaints."
"I've built probably a dozen computers by now and out of all the parts I've had go bad on me (and believe me it happens more than you think) motherboards tend to be the top contender (with ram sticks being a close second).It's easy to go on a site like PCPartPicker filter by compatibility sort by the lowest price first and then pick whatever motherboard is cheapest but you have to realize what you're paying for. Cheaper quality motherboards means less stable power delivery and lesser QC'ed parts. It means you'll be using your computer for X amount of months and then all of the sudden one day it just won't turn on then you have to RMA it and wait 2-5 weeks for a new one. Either that or it can cause you endless blue screens of death due to unstable power delivery. Just for the love of PCMR do not cheap out too much on your motherboard. That's all I ask!Edit: for those of you who are saying we should post an example of good motherboards I have decided I'll take it a step further and link Gamer's Nexus's (technically Buildzoid's) guide on the top 18 motherboards for AMD Ryzen B450 X470 and X570 chipsets. This video deeply analyzes each motherboard and explains what makes each one good or bad. So I'll link it ---> [here](https://youtu.be/JGY2mqTn2rc)Edit 2: I acknowledge that the post is largely anecdotal when it comes to actual failure rates so take all information given here with a grain of salt. The consensus seems to be for most users as long as you don't pick the absolute cheapest boards then you should be fine which I mostly largely agree with. Also you guys in the comments have been very helpful and nice about educating each other on things so I greatly appreciate it. Thanks for not being toxic!"
"Goodmorning everyonefinally after a few months of savings I was able to complete my build with the right monitor.I bought an LG UltraGear 27GL850-B and this is my build :Ryzen 5 3600X - Nvidia RTX 2070 Super - 8x2 3200Mhz LPXThanks to you and a lot of research I saved up to get only this monitor that fit in my pocket and convinced me as performance.Now I'm here for one last help as a non-expert in the video industry my one year build is composed with a 1080p dual monitor one 144hz (where I work/play) and one 75hz (desktop).Now that I set up the new monitor I would like to keep the old 1080p 144hz monitor as my desktop and the LG for work/play I limited myself to connecting everything but I would not like to create some conflict with 1080p 144hz and 1440p 144hz is there any particular setting to set?I made sure I got 144hz from the Nvidia control panel but nothing else.Thank youChris&#x200B;EDIT :When I woke up this morning I didn't expect all these comments!

"I fucked up you shouldn't.

"Otherwise you can rip your cpu out of socket beause it's glued to your cooler by some cold ass thermal paste. Certainly scary but not always damaging.

It states that the GPU might not be powered on properly if you use a 3rd party vendor connector and we recommend to use only our connector that comes with the GPU.We need to update this with the message below. 12-pin Adapter AvailabilityFor power connector adapters we recommend you use the 12-pin dongle that already comes with the RTX 3080 GPU. However there will also be excellent modular power cables that connect directly to the system power supply available from other vendors including Corsair EVGA Seasonic and CableMod.

"I've always built a middle of the road box never spending more than about $800-1000 on a build.  It always blows my mind when people sit down to build a $3000 monster with dual 1080s and a custom liquid cooling loop and all that.I wonder any folks out there who built such a machine 3-4 years ago...  how's the box coming along now? Have you made any upgrades?  Would you spend the same amount if you had to do it over again?Obligatory edit - Jesus christ my inbox."
"Ordered a EVGA 2080 super xc ultra and the package shipping details weren’t changing from departed from amazon facility for days. I contacted amazon and they told me the package is lost and issued a full refund. The same day I decided to order a 2080 super strix. I go to get my strix delivery today from my door step and to my surprise I have both the EVGA and the Strix waiting for me. What would y’all do in this situation? Should I contact amazon about it or can I keep it? I’m definitely going to be using the strix for my pc.Update: So after a lot of thought I decided I should contact amazon. I’ve had an amazon account for over 10 years and I didn’t want to put any red flags on the account as it is a family used account. Contacting them would go one of two ways I keep a free gpu without a guilty conscience or I pretend this never happened. Unfortunately it was the latter they did ask me to send it back. So they have scheduled a pickup of the package from my house. I’m pretty indifferent about the whole thing because when I “lost” the card I was pretty much over it and I accepted that I probably wouldn’t get it. Anyways it was a good run thanks everyone for your opinions. I didn’t expect to get this many upvotes and comments. Hope my build goes well with the strix!"
"Last summer i decided to upgrade my 6 year old gaming rig. (Xeon 1232v2 Gtx 970 24" 1080p 60hz monitor). I carefully observed prices and had i known the clusterfuck GPU situation i would have put all my effort to purchase/preorder a GPU in late summer/early fall.  My first upgrade was an Asus Rog Strix XG27WQ monitor for 419 € ( i am living in Germany). The upgrade was insane for gaming quality (165hz 1440p curved). On the other hand my GPU was now under heavy load and couldn't really handle 1440p. I also invested in 5 new Corsair case fans to get the airflow optimized in my pc case.Before Christmas i decided that it was a good time to purchase the core components because prices were good:    * Ryzen 5600x (60€ above msrp)  * Asrock B550 extreme4 MoBo  (-30€ msrp)  * 4x8 GB Patriot Viper DDR4 Ram Cl 19 /4400Mhz (-20€ msrp)  * Seasonic 750w Gold Psu (+15€ msrp)  * Be quiet Dark Rock 3 Cpu Cooler (msrp)  I overclocked the CPU to 445 Ghz (edited from Mhz...) with 12 V. I realized that my Ram purchase was overkill in terms of Mhz and decided to underclock it to 3600 Mhz and set the timings to 14-14-14-30. It took me almost 2 weeks for this but in hindsight i am really happy that i put in the effort because it taught me much about overclocking.    From my old Pc i am still using the case (Cooler Master 690 III) 2 SSDs(250 GB evo960 for windows 1 TB evo970 for games) and a 2 TB HDD for Data.    And yesterday arrived the final piece: My ASUS Tuf Gaming 3080 OC. It was unbelievable how much the GPU pushed my system to a new level. Sadly i payed much more than i wanted (1200€). But after 4 weeks of GPU hunting in 3 discords refreshing 14 Tabs countless times a day i decided to go for it. I am planning to undervolt it to 800/850 mV with 1800-1900 Mhz.    And that's it. It took me around 5 month which isn't that bad i guess. I am very happy with the components and everything synergizes good together. I hope you have enjoyed the read i might add pics later.      Edit1: Btw i wanted a clean build without any Rgb. The gpu only has a small Rgb display and the Motherboard also has rgb support but i turned it off.  Edit2: Here are the invite links to the discord servers [Part Alert](https://discord.gg/zdGqHfPQ) and [Stock Radar](https://discord.gg/Sn7xN7Xt)  Edit3: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/GpRHsHl) is a picture of my Pc. 1. My son will build a better GPU Lego stand dw.  2. Bonus points who will find my SSDs ;) 3. I am unhappy with the GPU cables because they hide the TUF Logo and they have both daisy chains. Are there any solutions besides putting the cables over the gpu?"
"I went ahead and built [a portable all in one PC case](https://i.imgur.com/nw49f4P.jpg) and thought others would be interested in the end result and process behind it."
